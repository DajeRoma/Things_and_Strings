Clinton was founded in the 1770s.
The town, then named Surratt's Villa, was actually a simple crossroads with a few buildings.
In the 1800s, it became known as Surrattsville.
The main building served as the post office, an inn and tavern, and a polling place.
This main residence was one of two properties owned by the widowed Mary Surratt; the second property was in Washington, D.C.
On 14 and 15 April 1865, John Wilkes Booth, who had two hours earlier assassinated President Abraham Lincoln, stopped by the Surrattsville tavern to pick up weapons and supplies.
The U.S. government alleged that Mary Surratt had gone there earlier with these supplies, and was in collusion with the conspirators, one of whom was her son, John Surratt.
Because she was found guilty of complicity in the Lincoln assassination, Mary Surratt was hanged at the Capitol Prison in Washington D.C., on 7 July 1865.
(Her house is now the Surratt House Museum, with a focus on the assassination.)
The U.S. Post Office renamed the town Robeysville, due to the notoriety of the Surratt name, and in keeping with naming towns after the post master.
In 1879, Robeysville was renamed Clinton.
The local high school, however, retains the name of Surrattsville, and some locals continue, in common usage, to call the town "Surattsville".
The Wyoming house, a historic frame house built in three phases between the 18th and early 19th centuries, is also a part of Clinton's history.
The house consists of a main block with gambrel roof (late 18th century), kitchen (c. 1800), and connecting block (c. 1850).
The Wyoming house is listed in the Maryland Inventory of Historical Properties and the Historic American Buildings Survey.
In 1913, Blossie Keubeth Miller founded a general store at the town's main intersection.
The current commercial property, built in the 1950s, houses a liquor store and was owned by the Miller family as recently as 2003.
Clinton has mostly single-family housing, but includes a few townhouse developments and one retirement mid-rise.
Southern Maryland Regional Hospital is in Clinton, as is a private airfield.
Louise F. Cosca Regional Park, a public facility operated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, offers camping, hiking, fishing in a lake, an excellent playground, and a nature museum with nature activities.
Clinton boasts a major shopping complex as well, and has a large fringe parking lot nearby where Metro buses take passengers a few miles to the Branch Avenue station of the Washington Metrorail system.
Clinton is also home to the James O.
Hall Research Center which is located on the premises of the Surratts House.
Major local growth began in the 1950s, spurred partly by the expansion of adjacent Andrews Air Force Base, home of the Air Force Systems Command and the President's plane Air Force One.
