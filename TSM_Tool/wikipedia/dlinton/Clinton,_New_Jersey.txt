Clinton is a town in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States, located on the South Branch of the Raritan River.
As of the 2010 United States Census, the town's population was 2,719, reflecting an increase of 87 (+3.3%) from the 2,632 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 578 (+28.1%) from the 2,054 counted in the 1990 Census.
When the Clinton post office was established in 1829, it was named for DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York and the primary impetus behind the then-newly completed Erie Canal.
Clinton was incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 5, 1865, within portions of Clinton, Franklin and Union Townships.
Clinton gained full independence from its three parent townships in 1895.
The town is perhaps best known for its two mills which sit on opposite banks of the South Branch Raritan River.
The Red Mill, with its historic village, dates back to 1810 with the development of a mill for wool processing.
Across the river sits the Stone Mill, home of the Hunterdon Art Museum for Contemporary Craft and Design, located in a former gristmill that had been reconstructed in 1836 and operated continuously until 1936.
In 1952, a group of local residents conceived of a plan to convert the historic building into an art museum, which is still in operation today.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 1.417 square miles (3.670 km2), including 1.338 square miles (3.465 km2) of land and 0.079 square miles (0.205 km2) of water (5.59%).
The town borders Clinton Township, Franklin Township, and Union Township.
Clinton is considered an exurb of New York City, as Hunterdon County lies on the western fringe of the New York City Metropolitan Area, which is mainly rural with scattered housing developments and old farm homes.
Clinton is part of the Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area of Middlesex, Somerset and Hunterdon counties in New Jersey.
It serves as a "bedroom community" for many commuters working in and around Northern New Jersey and New York City, often younger residents who have supplanted long-time residents of Clinton.
Climate
Clinton falls under the 'Northern New Jersey' climate zone.
According to the Office of the New Jersey State Climatologist at Rutgers University, the Northern climate zone covers about one-quarter of New Jersey and consists mainly of elevated highlands and valleys which are part of the Appalachian Uplands.
Surrounded by land, this region can be characterized as having a continental climate with minimal influence from the Atlantic Ocean, except when the winds contain an easterly component.
Prevailing winds are from the southwest in summer and from the northwest in winter.
Being in the northernmost portion of the state, and with small mountains up to 1,800 feet (550 m) in elevation, the Northern Zone normally exhibits a colder temperature regime than other climate regions of the State of New Jersey.
This difference is most dramatic in winter when average temperatures in the Northern Zone can be more than ten degrees Fahrenheit cooler than in the Coastal Zone.
Annual snowfall averages 40 to 50 inches (1,300 mm) in the northern zone as compared with an average of 10-15 inches in the extreme south.
Clinton falls under the USDA 6b Plant Hardiness zone.
