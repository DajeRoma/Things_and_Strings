Clinton is a city in Henry County, Missouri, United States.
The population was 9,008 at the 2010 census.
It is the county seat of Henry County.
Clinton was laid out in 1836.
The city was named for New York Governor DeWitt Clinton, a key promoter of the Erie Canal.
A post office called Clinton has been in operation since 1850.
On June 26, 2006, a building in the historic town square collapsed; on the second and third floors, an Elks Lodge (Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks) meeting was taking place.
The leader, Tony Komer, who was on the third floor of the building preparing a speech, is the only one who died.
Nine people were pulled from the rubble, while the rest left on their own power.
In the "Olde Glory Days" parade, which occurred less than one week after the accident, Komer was memorialized, and Elk's Lodge members from many parts of Western Missouri marched to show their support for the Clinton Lodge.
