Morgan's Raid
In June 1863, the Confederate cavalry under John Hunt Morgan had departed Tennessee on what would later become known as Morgan's Raid.
Traveling through Tennessee and into Kentucky, Morgan eventually crossed into Indiana; he reached Salem on July 10, 1863, coming north from Corydon.
Upon entering Salem at approximately 9 a.m., Morgan immediately took possession of the town and placed guards over the stores and streets.
The cavalrymen burned the large, brick railroad depot, along with all the train cars on the track and the railroad bridges on each side of the town.
Morgan demanded taxes from the two flour mills that belonged to DePauw and Knight, and from the Allen Wollen Mill.
Morgan's men looted stores and took about $500 from the area before departing about 3 p.m.
Of the brief action at Salem, Col.
Basil W. Duke, Morgan's second-in-command and brother-in-law, later said:
"They did not pillage with any sort of method or reason; it seemed to be a mania, senseless and purposeless.
One man carried for two days a bird cage containing three canaries.
Another rode with a huge chafing dish on the pommel of his saddle.
Although the weather was intensely warm, another slung seven pairs of skates around his neck.
I saw very few articles of real value taken; they pillaged like boys robbing an orchard."
Salem is primarily an agricultural community, surrounded by typical Indiana forests and farmland and small bodies of water.

Museums and other points of interest
The downtown area is on the National Register of Historic Places, as are several local buildings.
The Carnegie Library in Salem was one of nearly 2,000 libraries built in the United States including 164 in Indiana in the early 20th century with funds donated by steel conglomerate Andrew Carnegie.
Salem received the grant in February 1904, broke ground in August 1904 and opened in July 1905.
Still in use today, the Carnegie Library in Salem is one of just one hundred in the state of Indiana still being used for its original purpose.
Located in the center of Salem's town square, the Washington County Courthouse is generally known as Salem's most famous and recognizable landmark.
The courthouse has historical place markers surrounding it, and at the southeastern corner of the grounds, there is a memorial to veterans killed in action during conflicts dating back to the Revolutionary War.
The birthplace of John Hay has been a National Historic Site since 1971 and is located in Salem.
The building was originally used as a school house and was built in 1824.
It has been restored and furnished in the 1840 period.
Salem is also home to Salem Speedway.
It is a half mile high banked paved oval that was first built in 1947.
Many of the most legendary drivers of the past 50 years have raced there including Ted Horn, Parnelli Jones, AJ Foyt, Bobby and Al Unser, Mario Andretti, Larry Dickson, Darrell Waltrip and Jeff Gordon.
AJ Foyt at one time held the world record for a half mile oval at the speedway.
One of ESPN's first televised auto racing events was held there in 1979.
Unusual for a town of this size is a large children's playground, "Riley's Place" at DePauw Park.
Named after Riley Jean Tomlinson, a local toddler who accidentally drowned in a swimming pool, the park was built in 2001 and contains two- and three- story wooden castles and other structures for children's play (along with swings, slides, and similar playground equipment).
