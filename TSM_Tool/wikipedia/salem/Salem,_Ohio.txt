Salem is a city in northern Columbiana County and extreme southern Mahoning County, Ohio, United States.
At the 2010 census, the city's population was 12,303.
Salem is the principal city of the Salem, OH Micropolitan Statistical Area, while the small portion of the city that extends into Mahoning County is considered part of the Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Origins and settlers
Salem was founded by a Pennsylvanian potter, John Straughan, and a New Jersey clockmaker, Zadok Street, in 1806.
The name Salem was taken from "Jerusalem", which means "city of peace".
Early settlers to the city included the Religious Society of Friends (“Quakers”), which the school system’s sports teams honor by referring to themselves collectively as the "Quakers."
Salem was incorporated in 1830.
Contributions to American history
Active in the abolitionist movement of the early- to mid-19th century, Salem acted as a hub for the American Underground Railroad, with several homes serving as “stations.” Salem retains many of these homes, but none are open to the public at present.
Salem was a center for reform activity in several ways.
The Anti-Slavery Bugle, an abolitionist newspaper, was published in Salem beginning in 1845.
A local group of the Progressive Friends, an association of Quakers who separated from the main body partly so they could be freer to work for such causes as abolitionism and women's rights, was formed in Salem in 1849.
The local school board at that time was composed entirely of abolitionists.
In April 1850, Salem hosted the first Women's Rights Convention in Ohio, the third such convention in the United States.
(The first was the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848; the second was the Rochester Convention two weeks later.)
The Salem Convention was the first of these conventions to be organized on a state-wide basis.
All of the convention's officers were women.
Men were not allowed to vote, sit on the platform or speak during the convention.
The male spectators were supportive, however, and when the convention was over, they created an organization of their own and endorsed the actions of the women's convention.
While radio DJ Alan Freed was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, he grew up in Salem.
While working at a radio station in Cleveland, he coined the phrase "Rock & Roll."
Prosperity through industry
Over its history, Salem thrived on an industrial-based economy, advantageously located between Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
For several decades, the largest corporations located in Salem were American Standard, Eljer,Mullins Manufacturing, Deming Pump and Salem China.
Today, only American Standard and several tool-and-die manufacturers remain.
National recognition of historic resources
Two sections of the city are designated National Register historic districts: the "Salem Downtown Historic District” (bounded by Vine Avenue, Ohio Avenue, East Pershing Street, South Ellsworth Avenue, and Sugar Tree Alley, designated 1995), and the "South Lincoln Avenue Historic District" (designated 1993), which includes several of the town’s monumental and architecturally distinctive homes.
Other city properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places include: the Burchfield Homestead (home to Charles Burchfield from ages five to twenty-eight), Daniel Howell Hise House (home of local Quaker abolitionist and Underground Railroad station), the (Former) Salem Methodist Episcopal Church|First United Methodist Church of Salem, and the John Street House (Underground Railroad station and home to descendant of city founder).

Residents of land annexed to the city of Salem enjoy all benefits other residents of the city enjoy, and by Ohio law are now themselves residents of the city of Salem.
Several acres of Salem Township and Green Township were annexed into the city limits in 2000 and 2001.
Other actions to spur economic development undertaken around the same time annexed specific land: in 1999, 82.24 acres (332,800 m2) of Salem Township were granted police and fire protection, snow removal service, and other standard services already provided to the City of Salem by Ordinance passed by the city government.
