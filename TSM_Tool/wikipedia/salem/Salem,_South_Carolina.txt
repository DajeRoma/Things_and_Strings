Tamassee-Salem Middle-High School Controversy
In 2015 the SDOC school board voted 5-0 unanimously 5-0 to close Tamassee-Salem Middle/High School at the end of the school year.
This was met with a negative response by a lot of the parents that went to Tamassee-Salem or that had children there.
There was a petition up to keep the school open that had 332 supporters.
They eventually opened a charter school named 'EAGLE RIDGE'.
Most of the children that changed schools began going to Walhalla schools.
