Arlington has been called Shelby County’s best-kept secret, as it has remained a small quiet rural town for two centuries.
Settlers came to the area in the 1830s, and many of their descendants still live in the town.
Originally known as Haysville, the town was named after the original landowner, Samuel Jackson Hays, a nephew of President Andrew Jackson.
The area began to grow with the development of the Memphis and Ohio Railroad and the creation of Withe Depot within its boundaries.
By 1856, about 200 people called Haysville home.
The outbreak of yellow fever in Memphis in 1878 contributed to the stagnant population as the town fathers quarantined the area, forbidding outsiders from entering the town.
The town was incorporated as Haysville in 1878.
In 1883 the town's name was changed to Arlington due to the post office being unable to use the name Haysville.
In 1900 the town was incorporated again.
Captain Henry Pittman, who lived in Haysville, had visited Washington, D.C. and Arlington National Cemetery and was inspired to call the town Arlington.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 20.4 square miles (53 km2), of which 0.05% is water.
