Timber
From its founding, Arlington had an economy based on timber harvesting and processing, and timber products.
It was once dubbed the "Shingle Capital of the World," with numerous logging camps, sawmills, and shingle mills in the vicinity.
Railroad
Historically, Arlington developed as a railroad town with several different rail connections.
It was located on the Northern Pacific(NP) mainline that stretched from the Canada–US border through Sedro-Woolley to Snohomish, Washington.
Arlington also had a branch line running east to Darrington, which primarily carried timber products.
Both of these lines were abandoned in the 1980s by NP's successor Burlington Northern, due to declining traffic and national restructuring of the industry.
While the railroad is not as important to the city's economy as formerly, Arlington still maintains a rail connection with BNSF Railways via a spur line.
Various trestles and railroad signal equipment are still in place.
Snohomish County is in the process of converting the abandoned rail right-of-way into bike/hike trails under the federal Rails to Trails program.
