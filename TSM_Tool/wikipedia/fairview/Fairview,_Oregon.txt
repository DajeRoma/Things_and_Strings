Fairview is a city in Multnomah County, Oregon, United States.
As of the 2010 census, the city population was 8,920.
Members of the Multnomah tribe of Chinookan Indians lived in a village near the Columbia River and the future site of Fairview when the Lewis and Clark Expedition visited the area in 1806.
By the 1840s and 1850s, white settlers began hay, grain, and livestock operations in what became eastern Multnomah County.
Railroad tracks extended to the area by the 1890s, and, as the population grew, residents began referring to the locale as Fairview because of the pleasing views of the nearby river, the Columbia River Gorge, and Mount Hood.
Since another community named Fairview already existed on the Oregon Coast, the community's first post office was named Cleone until the coastal post office closed and the name was transferred to Fairview.
In the mid-1980s the city attempted to merge-in a large section of unincorporated territory in eastern Multnomah County.
The plan would have created a city of about 120,000 residents, which at the time would have ranked as the second most populous city in Oregon, behind only Portland.
In September 1985, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled the attempt was invalid as state law required two cities to start any attempt at consolidation, and only Fairview had initiated this attempt.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.58 square miles (9.27 km2), of which, 3.09 square miles (8.00 km2) is land and 0.49 square miles (1.27 km2) is water.
