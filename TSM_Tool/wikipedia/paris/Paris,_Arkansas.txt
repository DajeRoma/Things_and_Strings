Coal mining flourished.
In the 1890s, Paris was a bustling city of 800 people.
Citizens boasted of two newspapers, a bottling works company, nine general stores and the Paris Academy.
Coal mining was the community's main industry by 1917, but declined by the 60's.
As a result, community leaders sought to diversify the town's economic base.
Today, the economy of Paris is benefitting from the presence of manufacturing facilities producing parts for the automotive industry and the aerospace industry.
Farming and ranching remain among the largest industries in the county and tourism got a boost with the construction and opening of a 60-room, world-class lodge and guest cabins on the top of Mount Magazine, which is 19 miles from Paris.
An estimated 400,000 people a year travel to Mount Magazine State Park (2008 estimate).
Paris' schools have seen a steady increase in enrollment over the last three years.
The High School and Middle School switched campuses two years ago to complete a promise to the patrons that was made in 1988.
Several interests have been made in the area by bauxite mining companies looking to reduce the costs of aluminum foil production.
Last hanging in Arkansas
Paris was the site of the last public hanging in Arkansas before the first electric chair in Little Rock.
In 1914, Paris was thrown into turmoil from the murder of a young girl from Delaware, Arkansas.
A young man named Arthur Tillman was courting a girl named Amanda Stevens.
She disappeared one evening from her home and was found about eight days later, partly submerged in water in a well on the farm of Ambrose Johnson.
She was found with a large stone tied around her neck with telephone wire, a bullet through her head, and approximately a wagon load of rocks covering her body.
It is believed that the girl was not dead when she was put into the well because her hands were filled with dirt that could only result from a struggle or attempting to free herself.
On July 15, 1914, Arthur Tillman was hanged for the murder of his girlfriend, Amanda.
Today, the Jail (seen here) is now a museum dedicated to Logan County history.
Where spectators were located is now a road, joining to the main road, HWY 22.
You can tour through the entire building, jail keeper's living quarters side and the jail side.
There are many relics of Paris' past, such as farming equipment, clothing, and everyday objects from the settlers' lives, and exhibits of Native American artifacts, Civil War artifacts, and coal mining to name a few.
Paris Express
The Paris Express was founded in 1880, one year after the community of Paris was established and it is the oldest, continually operating business in Paris.
J.T.
Perryman was the first publisher and W.H.H.
Harley was the first editor.
During the next five years of its existence it had several owners.
In 1885 the weekly Express was purchased from Charles Noble by William M. Greenwood, former publisher of the Chismville Star and an associate with the Fort Smith Daily Tribune.
Greenwood published the Paris Express for 46 years until his death in 1929.
Hugh and J.C. Park of the Van Buren Press-Argus purchased the Express from the Greenwood estate and then sold it a few months later to Wallace D. Hurley.
Hurley published the paper until 1939 when it was purchased by John Guion and Robert Breeden.
Guion was editor and publisher of the Express and a sister paper, the Paris Progress, and in 1946 served as president of the Arkansas Press Association.
It was at that time that the Paris company began publishing the Charleston and Greenwood papers.
The Progress, which was launched in 1910 with J.W.
Wagner as owner and editor, started out as a semi-weekly.
In 1920 it was renamed the Paris Progress and in 1927 became a weekly.
By that time Leslie and C.E.
Gray, father and son, were the owners.
In 1941 it was sold to John Guion.
The Paris Commercial Press, which was only in business during 1937 became consolidated with the Progress.
It was also a weekly.
The papers were purchased in 1976 by Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc., of San Antonio, Tex.
from John Guion.
Victor Schneider continued as publisher.
On Jan. 1, 1987 the newspaper was purchased by Worrell Enterprises of Lynchburg, Va.
The Paris Express and the Paris Progress were combined into a bi-weekly bearing the name of Paris Express Progress in January 1977.
The Paris Express Progress was sold in April 1988 to Westward Communications, a Dallas-based company.
The bi-weekly Paris Express Progress combined into a "super" weekly issue on May 17, 1989 called the Paris Express.
In July 1997 Westward Communications sold to Westward Communications, LLC based out of The Woodlands, Tex.
Stephens Media Group purchased the Paris Express in March, 2000.
The company is based in Las Vegas, Nev. with Sherman Frederick, President and Michael Ferguson, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
Vickey Wiggins continued as publisher.
The Paris Express located at 22 South Express, currently employs six full-time employees and one part-time employee with a circulation of 3,600.

The festival is celebrated at two sites, atop Mount Magazine and in downtown Paris.
