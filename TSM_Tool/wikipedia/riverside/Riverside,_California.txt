Riverside is a city in Riverside County, California, United States, located in the Inland Empire metropolitan area.
Riverside is the county seat of the eponymous county and named for its location beside the Santa Ana River.
It is the most populous city in the Inland Empire and in Riverside County, and is located about 60 miles (97 km) east of Los Angeles.
It is also part of the Greater Los Angeles area.
Riverside is the 59th most populous city in the United States and 12th most populous city in California.
As of the 2010 Census, Riverside had a population of 303,871.
Riverside was founded in the early 1870s.
It is the birthplace of the California citrus industry and home of the Mission Inn, the largest Mission Revival Style building in the United States.
It is also home to the Riverside National Cemetery.
The University of California, Riverside, is located in the northeastern part of the city.
The university also hosts the Riverside Sports Complex.
Other attractions in Riverside include the Fox Performing Arts Center, Riverside Metropolitan Museum, which houses exhibits and artifacts of local history, the California Museum of Photography, the California Citrus State Historic Park, and the Parent Washington Navel Orange Tree, the last of the two original navel orange trees in California.
In the late 1700s and early 1800s, the area was inhabited by Cahuilla and the Serrano people.
Californios such as Bernardo Yorba and Juan Bandini established ranches during the first half of the 19th century.
In the 1860s, Louis Prevost launched the California Silk Center Association, a short-lived experiment in sericulture.
In the wake of its failure, John W. North purchased some of its land and formed the Southern California Colony Association to promote the area's development.
In March 1870, North distributed posters announcing the formation of a colony in California.
North, a staunch temperance-minded abolitionist from New York State, had formerly founded Northfield, Minnesota.
A few years later, some navel orange trees were planted and found to be such a success that full-scale planting began.
Riverside was temperance minded, and Republican.
There were four saloons in Riverside when it was founded.
The license fees were raised until the saloons moved out of Riverside.
Investors from England and Canada transplanted traditions and activities adopted by prosperous citizens.
As a result, the first golf course and polo field in Southern California were built in Riverside.
The first orange trees were planted in 1871, but the citrus industry Riverside is famous for beginning three years later (1874) when Eliza Tibbetts received three  Brazilian navel orange trees sent to her by a personal friend, William Saunders who was a horticulturist at the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C.
The trees came from Bahia, Brazil.
The Bahia orange did not thrive in Florida, but its success in Southern California was phenomenal.
The three trees were planted on the Tibbetts' property.
One of the trees died after it was trampled by a cow during the first year it was planted.
After the trampling, the two remaining trees were transplanted to property belonging to Sam McCoy to receive better care than L. C. Tibbetts, Eliza's husband, could provide.
Later, the trees were again transplanted, one at the Mission Inn property in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt (this tree died in 1922), and the other was placed at the intersection of Magnolia and Arlington Ave. Eliza Tibbetts was honored with a stone marker placed with the tree.
That tree still stands to this day inside a protective fence abutting what is now a major intersection.
The trees thrived in the Southern California climate and the navel orange industry grew rapidly.
Many growers purchased bud wood and then grafted the cuttings to root stock.
Within a few years, the successful cultivation of many thousands of the newly discovered Brazilian navel orange led to a California Gold Rush of a different kind: the establishment of the citrus industry, which is commemorated in the landscapes and exhibits of the California Citrus State Historic Park and the restored packing houses in the downtown's Marketplace district.
By 1882, there were more than half a million citrus trees in California, almost half of which were in Riverside.
The development of refrigerated railroad cars and innovative irrigation systems established Riverside as the richest city in the United States (in terms of income per capita) by 1895.
As the city prospered, a small guest hotel designed in the popular Mission Revival style, known as the Glenwood Tavern, eventually grew to become the Mission Inn, favored by presidents, royalty and movie stars.
Inside was housed a special chair made for the sizable President William Howard Taft.
The hotel was modeled after the missions left along the California coast by Franciscan friars in the 18th and 19th centuries.
(Although Spanish missionaries came as far inland as San Bernardino (San Bernardino de Sena Estancia), east of Riverside, there was no actual Spanish mission in what is now Riverside.)
Postcards of lush orange groves, swimming pools and magnificent homes have attracted vacationers and entrepreneurs throughout the years.
Many relocated to the warm, dry climate for reasons of health and to escape Eastern winters.
Victoria Avenue, with its scattering of elegant turn-of-the-century homes, and citrus-lined paseo, serves as a reminder of European investors who settled here.
Riverside is the 59th largest city in the United States, 12th largest city in California, and the largest city in California's Inland Empire metro area.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 81.4 square miles (210.8 km2), of which 81.1 square miles (210 km2) is land and 0.3 square miles (0.78 km2) (0.37%) is water.
The elevation of downtown Riverside is 860 feet (260 m).
Hills within the city limits include Mount Rubidoux, a city landmark and tourist attraction.
Riverside is surrounded by small and large mountains, some of which get a dusting of winter snow.
Many residents also enjoy the many beaches of Southern California.
Riverside is about a 47-mile drive to the Pacific Ocean.
Cityscape
Landmarks
Riverside is home to the historic Mission Inn, the Beaux-Arts style Riverside County Historic Courthouse (based on the Petit Palais in Paris, France), and the Riverside Fox Theater, where the first showing of the 1939 film Gone with the Wind took place.
The theater was purchased by the city and refurbished as part of the Riverside Renaissance Initiative.
The Fox Theater underwent extensive renovation and restoration, which was completed in 2009, to turn the old cinema into a performing arts theater.
The building was expanded to hold 1,600 seats and the stage was enlarged to accommodate Broadway-style performances.
In January 2010, singer Sheryl Crow opened the newly remodeled Fox Theater in a nearly sold-out show.
Riverside is also the home of the "World's Largest Paper Cup" (actually made of concrete), which is over three stories (68.10 ft) tall.
The "Dixie Cup" landmark is located on Iowa Street just north of Palmyrita, in front of what was once the Dixie Corporation's manufacturing plant (now closed down).
Three notable hills are in Riverside's scenic landscape: Box Springs Mountain, Evans (Jurupa) Hill and Tecolote Hill; all of which are preserved open spaces.
South of Riverside is Lake Mathews.
There is also the well-known landmark/foothill, Mount Rubidoux, which is next to the Santa Ana River and one of the most noticeable landmarks in the downtown area.
This foothill is the dividing line between the town of Rubidoux and the city of Riverside.
March Joint Air Reserve Base borders Riverside on the east serving as a divider between the city and Moreno Valley.
March ARB is the oldest operating Air Force base west of the Mississippi River, having been founded in 1918.
At the entrance to Riverside from the 60 freeway sits Fairmount Park.
This extensive urban oasis was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted.
Slightly fraying around the edges, it still has a lovely, stocked pond that is home to many species of birds.
On nearby private land is the former site of Spring Rancheria, a Cahuilla village.

Climate
Riverside experiences a semi-arid (Köppen climate classification BSh) climate with hot, dry summers and mild, relatively wet winters.
Temperatures in the summer generally average in the 90s (°F) but often exceed 100 °F (38 °C) though with somewhat low humidity.
In the winter, high temperatures average in the upper 60s (°F), but may not rise above 55 °F (13 °C) during rainy days.
January, the coldest month, averages a high / low temperature of 68 °F / 43 °F (20 °C / 6 °C), while August, the hottest month, averages a high / low temperature of 95 °F / 64 °F (35 °C / 18 °C).
Riverside receives 10.4 inches of precipitation annually with most of it occurring in the winter and early spring, especially January through March, with February the wettest month.
Environment
The Riverside area is referred to as a "smog belt" because of its above-average level of air pollution.
In a comparison by the National Campaign Against Dirty Air Power (2003), the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario area was found to be one of the most polluted regions based on year-round particle measurements when compared to other U.S. cities.
[NEJM 2004;351:1057-1067] Despite smog problems, the city has made efforts to reduce pollution by incorporating additional means of mass transit (Metrolink) and equipping its entire fleet of buses with natural gas.
Smog decreased considerably over the next few years as local municipalities and counties worked with the South Coast Air Quality Management District to implement measures to improve regional air quality.
The smog alerts that people remember from decades ago are history.
Most of Riverside's smog problems are the result of the prevailing wind patterns that blow the smog from the Los Angeles Basin and particulates generated by Southern California's multitude of vehicles, and the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach into the Inland Empire.

Religion
Riverside is largely Christian and home to Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Protestant churches, and an Islamic mosque, Mormon churches, Jewish synagogue, Hindu temple, several Buddhist temples, and a Universalist Unitarian church.
Riverside is also home to the Inland Empire Atheists and Agnostics organization.
Several religious celebrations take place on top of the city's Mount Rubidoux.
One is an annual Easter Sunrise service, which is the nation's oldest continual non-denominational outdoor Easter service The 100th anniversary of the event was held April 12, 2009.
Each December, a 2½-mile procession from Our Lady of Guadalupe Shrine to the top of Mount Rubidoux promotes awareness of Juan Diego's walk up Tepeyac hill, in 1531, where he reportedly saw a Marian apparition known as Our Lady of Guadalupe.
In 2012, a controversy erupted regarding the cross atop Mount Rubidoux, which was on city-owned land and maintained by the city.
Due to constitutional issues regarding separation of church and state, the Riverside City Council sold the cross and the land under it (0.43 acre) to a private entity for $10,500.
Local government
Riverside is governed by a city council and mayor.
The city council has seven members each elected from single member wards.

In Riverside's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, the city's government accounts were reported to have $244 million in revenues and $365 million in expenditures, with the deficiency made up by the issuance of long-term debt and transfers from the city-owned utilities (including electric and water).
The report also indicates that over the past 9 years, the number of city employees increased by 23.6% to 2686 FTE, outpacing the 12.5% increase in the number of residents.
Federal and State representation
Under the electoral maps drawn by the Citizens' Redistricting Commission, which were first used in the 2012 elections and will remain in effect through at least 2020, Riverside's state and federal legislative districts have changed substantially.
In the California State Senate, the city is in the 31st Senate District, represented by Democrat Richard Roth.
In the California State Assembly, it is split between the 60th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Sabrina Cervantes, and the 61st Assembly District, represented by Democrat Jose Medina.
In the United States House of Representatives, Riverside is in California's 41st congressional district, represented by Democrat Mark Takano.
Courts
Crime
Like much of the country, Riverside's crime rate has been steadily falling.

Initiative to raise college graduation rates
Riverside won a $3 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2010.
As a result, the Completion Counts initiative was created as a joint partnership by the city of Riverside, Riverside City College, Alvord Unified School District, Riverside Unified School District, Riverside County Office of Education, UC Riverside, and the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce to double college graduation rates by 2020.
Only Riverside, New York City, San Francisco, and Mesa, Arizona received such grant.
The partnership is creating measures that help students across Riverside earn a degree.
For example, RCC will now give 2012 graduates of AUSD and RUSD priority class registration, and a two-year guarantee to complete an associate degree or transfer to a four-year university.
Completion Counts is also ensuring that AUSD, RUSD and RCC work together to create a seamless math and English curriculum to prepare students for college-level work.
High school and college student counselors are meeting regularly to agree on the best ways to get students ready for college.

Highways
Riverside is served by three major freeways, the I-215, the State Route 60, and the State Route 91.
These three freeways meet in north-eastern Riverside at the rebuilt 60/91/215 interchange that was completed in late 2007.
Rail lines
The city contains two Metrolink commuter rail stations, Riverside-Downtown and Riverside-La Sierra.
Both are served by the Inland Empire-Orange County and 91 Lines, and the Downtown station is served by the Riverside Line on weekdays, and the San Bernardino Line on weekends.
Amtrak's Southwest Chief which runs from Los Angeles to Chicago also serves the city.
Bus lines
Local bus service is provided by the Riverside Transit Agency.
Recently, the agency proposed a new bus rapid transit route to travel along the current Route 1 from the University of California, Riverside to Corona.
The project is expected in FY 2011 or 2012, as funding is made available.
Intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines, Amtrak California, and a handful of small operators serving the cross-border market into Mexico.
Airports
The Riverside Municipal Airport (FAA designator: RAL) with a 5,400-foot (1,600 m) runway, is the only airport within Riverside's city limits, and is the location for the annual Riverside Air Show.
The airport is primarily used for private and business aviation.
The nearest major airport is the Ontario International Airport in the city of Ontario, California (FAA designator: ONT), about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Riverside.
Sister cities
Riverside has nine sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:
The Sendai Committee is working on setting up a secure e-pal system whereby the residents of Sendai and Riverside can exchange emails in a fashion similar to pen pals.
The aim is to promote grassroots cultural exchange between the two sister cities.
The city of Riverside established an economic partnership program with the state of Oaxaca, Mexico in the early 2000s (decade).
