Alluvial soils such as Pardee Cobbly Loam is found throughout the Jackson area.
Early history
The area was inhabited by the Northern Sierra Indians, who occupied areas along creeks, spring and seep areas, including permanent and seasonal drainages, flat ridges and terraces.
Therefore, areas along watercourses are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources.
Permanent villages were usually placed on elevations above seasonal flood levels.
Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.
Recent history
Jackson, named after Colonel Alden Jackson, was founded in 1848 around a year-round spring.
Settlement of the region by American pioneers was stimulated by the discovery of gold in the Sierra foothills around 1848.
The settlement was named for a local lawyer who was liked by miners named Alden Appola Moore Jackson.
Although Amador County was an important mining center, its County seat of Jackson was not typical of the early gold camps.
The camp grew quickly, as besides being a popular mining spot, it was also a convenient stopping place on the road from Sacramento to the Southern Mines.
The camp became an important supply and transportation center for the neighboring towns, and by 1850 the population had reached an estimated 1,500.
Jackson grew first as a watering hole for cattle, then as one of the earliest and most durable of the Mother Lode's hard rock mining areas.
In 1853, Jackson became the county seat of newly formed Amador County, California.
Previously, from 1851–1852, it had been the county seat of Calaveras County.
Jackson may therefore be the only city to have ever been county seat of two different counties at different times.
Placer mining gave out by the 1860s, replaced by hard rock mining.
One of the town's most prominent historical landmarks, the Kennedy Mine, began operation in 1860; at the time of its closure during World War II in 1942, it was the deepest gold mine in North America, at 1802 meters; (5912 ft).
On August 27, 1922 47 miners became trapped when a fire broke out in the Argonaut mine.
All 47 men died in the fire but it wasn't until over a year later that the last body was recovered.
The Argonaut mine incident was the worst gold mine disaster in US history.
In Oct, 1942 the US government passed the War Production Board Limitation Order which signaled the demise of gold mining in California.
The government needed men for the war and gold was not considered a strategic war metal.

Jackson Gate: Jackson Gate, on the north fork of Jackson Creek, takes its name from a fissure in a reef of rock that crosses the creek.
In 1850 about 500 miners worked here and the first mining ditch in the county was dug here; its water sold for $1 per inch, CHL No.

Site of Jackson's Pioneer Jewish Synagogue: On September 18, 1857, Congregation B'nai Israel of Jackson dedicated on this site the first synagogue in the Mother Lode.
High holy day worship continued until 1869 when the larger Masonic Hall was used to accommodate the congregation.
The wooden structure then served as a schoolhouse until 1888.
Relocated onto a nearby lot, it became a private dwelling, and was razed in 1948, CHL No.
