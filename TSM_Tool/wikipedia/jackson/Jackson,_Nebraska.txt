Jackson is a village in Dakota County, Nebraska, United States.
It is part of the Sioux City, IA–NE–SD Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The population was 223 at the 2010 census.
Prior to the establishment of Jackson, the townsite of Old St. John's was settled approximately 1.5 miles north of the current site of Jackson on June 2nd, 1856, by a Catholic colony of sixty Irish immigrants led by Father Trecy.
The colony was one of the first towns settled in Dakota County, and the first Catholic parish in Nebraska.
When the rising Missouri River began to threaten the town around 1860, all of the residents of Old St. John's moved south to what is now known as Jackson.
Jackson was originally called Franklin, and under the latter name was laid out in about 1860.
When it was discovered there was another post office in the state with the name Franklin, the community was renamed in honor of Andrew Jackson in order to avoid repetition.
