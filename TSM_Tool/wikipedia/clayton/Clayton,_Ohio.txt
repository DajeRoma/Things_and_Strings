In fiction
Part of Ayn Rand's novel The Fountainhead is set at Clayton.
In the early 1930s the novel's male protagonist, the controversial architect Howard Roark, gets a contract to build in Clayton the fictional Janer's Department Store, a five-story building.
Later on Roark's beloved, Dominique Francon, comes seeking him there, and feels that in a sense Clayton "belongs to her more than to any of its inhabitants" because her beloved is there.
The book presents Clayton as the archetype of "Middle America", the polar opposite of the cosmopolitan New York City where most of the plot takes place.
