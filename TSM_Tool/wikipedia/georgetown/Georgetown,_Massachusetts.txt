Georgetown is a town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States.
The population was 8,183 at the 2010 census.
It was incorporated in 1838 from part of Rowley.
Georgetown was originally settled in 1639 as a part of the town of Rowley by the Reverend Ezekiel Rogers.
The town at the time stretched from the Atlantic coast to the Merrimack River, south of Newbury and north of Ipswich.
Several farmers, finding suitable meadowlands in the western half of the settlement, began settling along the Penn Brook by the middle of the seventeenth century, creating Rowley's West Parish.
Though not directly involved in King Philip's War, the village nonetheless did become a victim of Indian raids.
The village, which became known as New Rowley, grew for many years, with small mills and eventually a shoe company opening up in the town.
By 1838, the town was sufficiently large enough for its own incorporation, and was renamed Georgetown.
Small industry continued, and today the town is mostly residential in nature, a distant suburb of Boston's North Shore.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 13.2 square miles (34.1 km2), of which 12.9 square miles (33.3 km2) is land and 0.31 square miles (0.8 km2), or 2.20%, is water.
