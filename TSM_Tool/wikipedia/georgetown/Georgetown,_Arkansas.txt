Georgetown is a town in southeastern White County, Arkansas, United States, overlooking the White River.
First settled in 1789 before the Louisiana Purchase, the community is the oldest continuously settled area in Arkansas.
The settlement of Arkansas Post, which began in 1686, came more than a century earlier, though that community dissolved in the years following the American Civil War.
The state's next oldest community after Georgetown — Batesville — was founded approximately 21 years later.
In 1945, the White River flooded its banks in Georgetown.
