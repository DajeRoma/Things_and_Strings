Georgetown is a home rule-class city in Scott County, Kentucky, in the United States.
The 2015 population was 32,356 per the United States Census Bureau.
It is the 7th-largest city by population in the U.S. state of Kentucky.
It is the seat of its county.
It was originally called Lebanon when founded by Rev.
Elijah Craig and was renamed in 1790 in honor of President George Washington.
It is the home of Georgetown College, a private liberal arts college.
Georgetown is part of the Lexington-Fayette, KY Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The city's growth began in the mid-1980s, when Toyota built Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky, its first wholly owned United States plant, in the city.
The plant, which currently builds the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Venza, Avalon, and Lexus ES automobiles, opened in 1988.
It is the largest building in terms of acres covered under one building in the United States, with over 200 acres (0.8 km2) occupied.
The city previously served as the training camp for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals.
Native peoples have lived along the banks of Elkhorn Creek in what is now Scott County for at least 15,000 years.
European exploration can be dated to a June 1774 surveying expedition from Fincastle County, Virginia, led by Colonel John Floyd.
For his military service, he was granted a claim of 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) in the area by the state of Virginia.
He named it Royal Spring but did not settle it.
John McClellan was the first to settle the area and established McClellan's Station there in 1775, but the compound was abandoned following an Indian attack on December 29, 1776.
In 1782, the Baptist preacher Elijah Craig led his congregation to the site and established a new settlement which he called Lebanon.
This was incorporated by the Virginia legislature in 1784.
Craig established some of the first mills west of the Appalachian Mountains along the Royal Spring Branch, manufacturing cloth and paper.
He also founded a distillery in 1789, as well as a school called the Rittenhouse Academy.
This eventually grew into Georgetown College.
The city's name was changed to George Town in honor of President George Washington in 1790.
When Kentucky became the 15th U.S. state in 1792 and formed Scott County, George Town became its seat of government.
The name was formally changed to Georgetown in 1846.
During the Civil War, Georgetown was raided by Confederate Gen. John Hunt Morgan twice, once on July 15, 1862, and the second time on July 10, 1864.
Following the war, the town became a railroad hub, connected to the Cincinnati Southern, the Louisville Southern, and the Frankfort & Cincinnati.
The last was considered the "whiskey route" and brought much of the region's bourbon to market.
From 1896 to 1987, the Cardome Centre site was the location of a girl's academy founded by the Sisters of Visitation.
It now serves as a community center for the city of Georgetown.
Throughout the 20th century, Georgetown has been in transition from an economy based primarily on agriculture, to a diversified one mixing manufacturing, small business, and the family farm.
During the 1960s, the construction of Interstate 75 placed the city on one of the busiest highways in America.
The selection of Georgetown as the site of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky in 1985 has resulted in the greatest period of growth in the city's history.
The historic Ward Hall, now the home of The Ward Hall Preservation Foundation, is located just outside Georgetown.
Ward Hall was the summer home of Junius Ward.
The home represents the height of the Greek Revival period of architecture in Kentucky.
The Georgetown business section has a historic district known as the Oxford Historic District.
