Greenville, commonly known as Edgemont, is a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County, New York, United States.
The population was 7,116 at the 2010 census.
The majority of its residents refer to it as Edgemont and that is the name of its school district.
It is a suburb of New York City, lying 22 miles (35 km) north of Columbus Circle.
It is a bedroom community, with many of its residents working in Midtown Manhattan.
Other workplaces of Greenville residents are in the office parks of White Plains, Purchase, Armonk, Westport, Connecticut or Stamford, Connecticut, as well as many local businesses in southern Westchester County.
The limits of the CDP are essentially defined by the areas served by the Edgemont Union Free School District and the Greenville Fire Department.
Greenville was originally a development designed by different architects for summer homes for Manhattanites.
With its antique colonial homes and outstanding schools, it is an attractive option for those seeking to move from New York City.
Metro-North trains are accessible via the Scarsdale and Hartsdale train stations, and they run 25–46 minutes to Grand Central Terminal, depending on if one has an express or local train.
Greenville comprises two ZIP codes: 10583 (Scarsdale, New York) and 10530 (Hartsdale, New York).
Both ZIP codes encompass significant area outside of Greenville as well.
While the bulk of Greenville lies within the Scarsdale zip code, none of Greenville is part of the village of Scarsdale.
According to a local real estate broker, "Edgemont is smaller and more intimate than Scarsdale".
Essentially, Greenville is an unincorporated CDP within Greenburgh, New York, but with a Scarsdale, New York or Hartsdale, New York mailing address depending on where in the CDP someone is.

Central Avenue also has an express bus running to 5th Avenue in Manhattan, but this takes considerably longer than the Metro-North due to traffic on the Major Deegan Expressway.
