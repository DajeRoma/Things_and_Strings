Veterans Plaza
The Muhlenberg County Veterans Mall and Plaza was originally constructed in the mid 1980s as the "Muhlenberg County War Memorial" to honor veterans who fought in World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.
The construction of the current plaza began in the mid 2000s as a part of the Muhlenberg County Courthouse renovations.
New additions to the memorial include the Lt. Ephraim McLean Brank Memorial, located at the entrance of the plaza and the Historic Gristmill Stone which is a tribute to the song "Paradise" by John Prine.
Thistle Cottage
Thistle Cottage, formerly the Duncan Cultural Center, occupies the former home of William Graham Duncan on Cherry Street in Greenville.
Constructed in 1912, the home was donated to the city of Greenville by Hamilton Richardson Duncan, Sr., the last of the Duncan family to reside there, in 1986.
It became the Duncan Cultural Center a year later but did not open to the public until 1989.
The house became a part of Muhlenberg County Public Libraries in 2013, at which time the name reverted to Thistle Cottage, as the home was originally christened by builder William G. Duncan.
Today, the Center displays a number of artifacts related to the history and culture of Muhlenberg County, including a coal museum.
It is also available for rent to host parties and other special events.
