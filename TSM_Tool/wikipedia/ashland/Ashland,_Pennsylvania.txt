Ashland is a borough in Schuylkill County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, 15 miles (24 km) northwest of Pottsville.
A small part of the borough also lies in Columbia County, although all of the population resided in the Schuylkill County portion as of the 2010 census.
The borough lies in the anthracite coal region of eastern Pennsylvania.
Settled in 1850, Ashland was incorporated in 1857, and was named for Henry Clay's estate near Lexington, Kentucky.
The population in 1900 was 6,438, and in 1940, 7,045, but had dropped to 2,817 at the 2010 census.
Ashland is part of the Pottsville Micropolitan Statistical Area.
It is the location of Pioneer Tunnel, a tourist attraction featuring a tour of a coal mine on mine cars and a separate 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) narrow gauge steam train ride.
For a long time after southern Pennsylvania was settled, the area that is now Ashland was mostly wilderness except for a hotel in the area in 1820.
A prominent citizen of the county, Burd S. Patterson, however, predicted that the area would eventually become a prominent mining town.
In 1845, John P. Brock and James Hart joined Patterson in buying 800 acres (320 ha) of land in the Ashland area.
In 1846, a group of miners led by Patrick Devine developed coal seams in veins in the area.
However, the town progressed little over the next three years.
By 1857, though, the town had 3,500 people, and Ashland became a borough, detaching itself from Butler Township.
The first post office was built in 1853, and the first church was built in 1855.
The Mothers' Memorial is located at the junction of Pennsylvania Route 54 and Pennsylvania Route 61.
The Mothers' Memorial is a bronze reproduction of the famous James Abbott McNeill Whistler artistic painting: An Arrangement in Grey and Black No.
1, commonly known as "Whistler's Mother".
The WPA-Built Mothers' Memorial honors all mothers of the United States and it's the only one of its kind in the world.
The Mothers' Memorial was commissioned and erected during the misery of the Great Depression in the United States by the Ashland Boys' Association and it was dedicated on Sunday, September 4, 1938, during Labor Day weekend.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt economic recovery plan of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) completed the historical stone masonry work.
The Ashland Boys' Association was an inspirational story of former residents of Ashland who had to leave town for work when the anthracite mining failed in the late 1800s.
Ashland men returned home every Labor Day weekend for little more than a century to visit the old hometown and march in the grand Ashland Boys' Association Mummers' Parade.
This unique show of attachment to family, friends, and comforts of home erected the WPA-built Mothers' Memorial statue that became the Ashland Boys' Association's legacy - An American Icon and a symbol of motherhood in the United States.
The Ashland Boys' Association was honored with a State Historical Marker (-76.33721, 40.78368) by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission on August 31, 2013.
Goyne Brothers was a family owned firm that came into existence in 1881.
Goyne Brothers which later changed the name in 1903 to Goyne Steam Pump Company were manufacturers of general mining machinery, and in 1883, they determined to make the manufacture of mining pumps as a specialty.
The Goyne Steam Pump Company in 1911, became known as one of the most substantial exclusive mine pump manufacturing plants in the United States.
The importance of coal mining drainage launched out mine pumpers exclusively and the Goyne Steam Pump Company invented, engineered, manufactured, and sold over 250 different mining pump designs and sizes, ranging from single pump up to the largest compound condensing duplex machines practicable for mining purposes throughout the anthracite and bituminous coal regions of Pennsylvania, and the United States.
The Goyne Steam Pump Company changed the name to Goyne Pump Company in 1955, and the company was purchased in 1979 by Goulds Pumps.
The Ashland Greens were an independent basketball franchise in Ashland.
The Ashland Greens played the Boston Celtics in the Ashland High School Gymnasium.
The team was owned by Green's Dairy.
Pennsylvania Route 61 takes a detour just north of Ashland, where a "Keep Out" sign straddles the original highway that used to lead to the abandoned town of Centralia, where an underground mine fire has been burning since 1962.
