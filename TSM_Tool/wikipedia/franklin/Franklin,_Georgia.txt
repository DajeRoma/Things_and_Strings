Old Heard County Jail
Pauly Jail Company of Alabama built the jail in 1912 for $7,500, using plans by Manly Jail Works of Dalton, Georgia.
It replaced an older jail built in 1880 that had become unfit.
The jail housed up to 16 prisoners upstairs.
The Heard County Sheriff (there were eight sheriffs from 1912–1964) and his family lived downstairs.
In the 1930s, two prisoners cut the window bars and escaped.
Death row prisoners were held here, but the jail's gallows were never used.
In 1964, a new county jail opened on the Franklin Square and the old jail closed.
The jail was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 27, 1981.
In 1987 it was completely restored by the Heard County Historical Society.
It now serves as a museum and historical center.
