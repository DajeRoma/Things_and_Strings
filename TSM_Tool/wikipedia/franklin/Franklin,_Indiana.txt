Downtown Franklin is noted for the number of well-maintained, older houses and early brick streets.
Landmark buildings include the Johnson County Courthouse and the Artcraft Theatre.
Due west of the Artcraft is City Hall, a Colonial Revival building constructed in 1936 to be used as a post office.
It was designed by architect Louis A. Simon under Postmaster General James Farley.
It was the original site of a federally commissioned Works Progress Administration (WPA) mural painted by Franklin artist Jean Swiggett, who started his career during the difficult years of the Great Depression.
The WPA work was moved to the "new" post office when it was built by the federal government.
In the 1980s, a private non-profit group, Franklin Heritage, Inc., was formed by citizens to preserve and restore its historic assets for new purposes.
It now owns the Artcraft Theatre and is making it a community center for film, art, and special events.
The Franklin Parks and Recreation Department maintains several miles of walking trails through the city, which connect various parks, community centers, the public library, and the public pool.
Due to flood damage, the long park along the creeks was closed for the summer of 2008.

Its students add to the life of the town and college events are open to the community.
The Daily Journal is the local newspaper in Franklin and also covers news in all of Johnson County.
The government consists of a mayor and a city council of seven members.
The mayor is elected by citywide vote.

Franklin Community Schools operates public schools serving almost all of the city, including Franklin Community High School.
A small section in the north is assigned to Clark-Pleasant Community School Corporation, served by Whiteland Community High School.
The December 2, 1940 issue of Life magazine included a photo essay by Bernard Hoffman entitled, "A Small Town's Saturday Night," depicting farmer Glen Dunn and family on a typical Saturday night in Franklin: Dad getting a hair cut, and the kids seeing a movie at the Artcraft, people at the drugstore, as well as photos of other social spots, such as Nick's Candy Kitchen and the town's "lovers' lane."
The nighttime photo showing double-parked cars and thick crowds on Jefferson Street is perhaps the best known of the set.
According to the late-20th century critic James Guimond in his book on American photography,
Since "Life" wanted a perfect Saturday night, and one they considered typical, the photographer did not select a town still blighted by the Depression... What "Life's"' readers wanted, it seemed, was a stereotyped village that confirmed their nostalgic beliefs about small towns in which no one is bored, poor, or lonely; and the magazine's photographers and editors - like Norman Rockwell in his "Saturday Evening Post" covers - gave them exactly that kind of town.
The small town became nationally famous during the 1920s due to the outstanding athletic achievements of the local high school basketball team, who became known as the Franklin Wonder Five.
A small group who had played together as boys, led by Fuzzy Vandivier and coached by Ernest "Griz" Wagner, they became the first high school team to win the state championship for three consecutive years (1920–22).
The youths followed Wagner to the local Franklin College, where he became coach and they earned the title of national college champions in 1923.
They turned down an offer to play against the top professional team, the New York Celtics.
