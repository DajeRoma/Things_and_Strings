Franklin is a city in Howard County, Missouri, United States.
It is located along the Missouri River.
Part of a rural area, the population was 95 at the 2010 census.
It is part of the Columbia, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area.
As the eastern terminus of the Santa Fe Trail, the community played a major role in the westward expansion of the United States.
The town of Franklin was founded in 1816 and named for Founding Father Benjamin Franklin.
William Becknell, known as the "Father of the Santa Fe Trail" lived on a farm a few miles northwest of Franklin.
There was a spring near Becknell's property, Boone Lick Spring.
The spring and its saline water were sufficient to attract people from St. Louis and points east, who came to distill the water for its salt.
They came so often that they created a trail, calling it the Boonslick Road.
The Boone refers to Nathan and Daniel Morgan Boone, sons of Daniel Boone; the brothers first operated the saltlick business.
In 1821, William Becknell put a notice in the "Missouri Intelligencer" stating he was creating a party to go "westward, for the purpose of trading for horses and mules and catching wild animals of every description."
On September 1, 1821, his party crossed the Missouri River at Arrow Rock and set out along what would become known in a few years the Santa Fe Trail.
A devastating flood of the Missouri River destroyed much of Franklin in 1827.
Residents rebuilt a short distance away on higher ground, creating New Franklin, Missouri.
The Cedar Grove was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
Kit Carson
Born in Madison County, Kentucky, near the city of Richmond, Kit Carson was raised in Franklin after migrating there as a boy with his family.
Lindsey Carson was a farmer of Scots-Irish descent, who had fought in the Revolutionary War under General Wade Hampton.
He had a total of fifteen surviving children: five by his first wife, and ten by his second wife (Kit's mother), Rebecca Robinson.
The Carson family settled on a tract of land owned by the sons of Daniel Boone, who had purchased the land from the Spanish prior to the United States annexing the territory by the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.
The Boone and Carson families became good friends, working, socializing, and intermarrying.
Carson was eight when his father was killed by a falling tree while clearing land.
The father's death reduced the Carson family to a desperate poverty, forcing young Kit to drop out of school to work on the family farm, as well as engage in hunting.
At the age of 14, Kit was apprenticed to a saddlemaker (Workman's Saddleshop) in Franklin.
The town was the eastern terminus of the Santa Fe Trail, which had opened two years earlier.
Many of the clientele at the saddleshop were trappers and traders, from whom Kit would hear stirring tales of the Far West.
Carson is reported to have found work in the saddle shop suffocating: he once said "the business did not suit me, and I concluded to leave".
Around 1826, aged 16, Kit secretly signed on with a large merchant caravan heading to Santa Fe.
