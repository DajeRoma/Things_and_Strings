On December 20, 1839, the south portion of the Town of Kinnikennick was split off to form the town of Franklin.
The town consisted of a 36-square-mile area that was originally covered with heavy timber, which was mostly hardwoods such as hickory, walnut, and butternut.
Most of the town's drainage was delivered by the Root River and there was an abundance of wildlife including bears, deer, and wolves.

The name "Franklin" was given in homage to Benjamin Franklin.
By the 1950s, Franklin was known as a "City of homes" for its growing residential areas, which served as a suburb of the city of Milwaukee.

In response, the town was incorporated as a fourth-class city on August 15, 1956.

Environmental concerns
Franklin is home to one of the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund sites.
Referred to as the "Fadrowski Drum Disposal Site", or FDDS, the 40-acre (160,000 m2) site located at 42°55′14″N 87°57′10″W 6865 South 27th Street was found to be contaminated with high amounts of lead and chromium.
Trace amounts of arsenic and DDT were also found.
The site also contains levels of mercury above Wisconsin enforcement standards.
The site once included a man-made pond with elevated cyanide levels.
The site was placed on the National Priorities List in 1986, with remedial action (RA) completed in 1994.
The site was deleted from the National Priorities List in 2003.
The site remedies included restricting access to the site, restricting use of land at the site, limited excavation of the waste (some drums), removal of hazardous soil, monitoring ground water, monitoring surface water, and installing a landfill cap.
The site has been largely remediated via landfill and limited excavation, however waste material above health-based levels was left on site.
The site is currently under a monitoring status, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reviewing the site every five years.
The site is now encircled by development.
It is bordered on the north by an Hobby Lobby, a tributary that flows into the Root River, and South 27th Street.
The southern boundary of the site is lined with Goodwill Industries and Gander Mountain retail stores.
Residential properties are just 1,000 feet (300 m) west of the site and 600 feet (180 m) to the south.
A Walmart is just 600 feet (180 m) north of the site.
The site itself is prohibited from ever being used for potable water, residential development, or any development that would disturb the landfill cap.
