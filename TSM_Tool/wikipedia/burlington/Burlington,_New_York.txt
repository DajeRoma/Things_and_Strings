Burlington was formed from the Town of Otsego, April 10, 1792.
It retained its original dimensions until 1797, when Pittsfield (and what would come to be New Lisbon) was set off.
It was further diminished in area by the erection of Edmeston, in 1808.
The 1878 history describes the community of Burlington Green as having two churches, a general store, lawyer office, hotel, gristmill, creamery, two blacksmith shops, two wagon shops, a cooper and shoe shop and photography studio, but "This village at one time was a place of much more mercantile and manufacturing interest than at present, having a comb-factory, a hattery, two tanneries, an iron-foundry, a furniture-factory, three stores, two hotels, a cloth-dressing and wool carding-factory, and a card factory."
The heavily textile based economy of the Butternut Valley was an influence in the number of sheep and immigrants that arrived from Scotland and established the United Presbyterian Church at Burlington Green June 8, 1835.
