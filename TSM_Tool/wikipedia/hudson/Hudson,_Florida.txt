In 1878, Isaac Hudson moved his family to the uninhabited brush of coastal Pasco County and established a post office at a place he named Hudson's Landing.
The town grew in the early twentieth century when the Fivay Company [1] began cutting lumber and shipping it by rail to Tampa.
Hudson stagnated when the Fivay Company went out of business and people turned to the sea or moved away; shrimping and fishing employed about half of the working men in the 1930s to 1950s.
In the late 1950s, a team of realtors paid the Army Corps of Engineers to dig 25 miles of canals as if they were streets.
The lots along the new waterfront area were then sold, bringing many new residents to Hudson.
In the 1980s, people began building larger homes (most of which were mobile homes) along the canals.
Now, while its older waterfront is reviving, large residential developments are spreading inland.
Former Red Sox pitcher Steven Dennett was born and raised in Hudson, Florida.
Robert J. Strickland Memorial Park (Hudson Beach) was built in the 1960s and is the main beach for the Hudson community.
Several restaurants in the area offer water views of the gulf or adjacent canals.
Veterans Memorial Park and Arthur F. Engle Memorial Park are the main indoor and outdoor sports and recreation centers, with indoor gymnasiums and outdoor fields.
There are also three semiprivate golf courses: Links Golf Club, Meadow Oaks Golf & Country Club, and Seapines Golf Club.
[2] Hudson once proclaimed itself the "Gopher Racing Capital of the World".
In 1977, William Trippett raced his Gopher Tortoise, ST. Pete Flash, to victories in the 8-10 year old division and also in the overall division.
It was the 2nd year in a row that St. Pete Flash had swept the races in Hudson during their July 4 celebration.
He won the women's division and overall title for Donna Trippett in 1976.
Hudson also is host to a number of vacation resorts, including a "clothing optional" AANR resort.
They provide camping and RV, including rentals.
Lodging & Dining
Inside of Robert J. Stickland Memorial is the Inn on the Gulf.
The Inn on the Gulf is Pasco County's only beachfront restaurant, bar and motel.
Also inside of the park is Sam's Hudson Beach Bar.
Sam's has been a favorite of locals and tourists since the early 80's.
The latest arrival in Hudson is the Route 66 Diner franchise which has recreated and billed the original 50's Diner as Franchise Store #1.
The Route 66 Diner is housed in the original Krystal diner which was built in the 1950s and then moved from Clearwater to Hudson, Florida in pieces (up the coast) and then re-constructed.
