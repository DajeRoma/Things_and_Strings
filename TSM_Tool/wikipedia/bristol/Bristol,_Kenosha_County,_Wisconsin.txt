Border dispute
The Town of Bristol was involved in annexation disputes with Pleasant Prairie during the 1990s.
The two entities reached a boundary agreement in 1997; as a result, the Circuit Court of Kenosha County dismissed motions by Pleasant Prairie to annex portions of the town.
Dis-establishment
In 1968, a state court denied the Town of Bristol's earlier petition to incorporate itself as a village.
On January 19, 2009, a state court rejected an attempt by the western half of Bristol to incorporate, which had been filed in 2008.
A second attempt to incorporate a smaller section of the northwest corner of the town (filed in March 2009) was approved by the court on September 17, 2009 and was enacted with the incorporation of the Village of Bristol that year.
On June 29, 2010, in a special election, most of the remainder of the town of Bristol was annexed to the village of Bristol (effective July 4, 2010), while a small section of the town was annexed to the village of Pleasant Prairie.
