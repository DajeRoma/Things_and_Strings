History
Newport was given its name in 1890 because it was selected as a landing site for the first steamboat on the Pend Oreille River.
Newport was officially incorporated on April 16, 1903.
The first river bridge was built in 1906, and was replaced in 1926, and again in 1988.
On July 14, 2015, an explosion took place at Zodiac Aerospace.
Five people were injured, and people were urged to stay at least 2000 feet from the facility.
Newport is located at 48°10′50″N 117°2′51″W (48.180634, -117.047407) at an elevation of 2,160 feet (658.5 m).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.07 square miles (2.77 km2), all of it land.
The town of Oldtown, Idaho is just to the east of Newport, and on the Pend Oreille River.
There are no natural or physical barriers between the two towns, and it is strictly a political division, separated by the straight-line state boundary.
About one-half mile north of Newport, the Pend Oreille River enters Washington State and flows north to Canada.
The watershed of the Pend Oreille in the Newport-Oldtown area west of the river is extremely limited.
This is due to a small depression of no more than 50 feet (15 m), which begins about one-half mile from the river.
Unable to flow uphill, the waters (from natural springs, rainfall runoff, etc.)
eventually form the Little Spokane River, and flow southwest towards Spokane.
Diamond Lake, WA (elevation 2,345 ft.) is about 7 miles (11 km) to the southwest, and is also part of the Little Spokane River watershed (outflow only) via a creek runoff from the uninhabited far west end of the lake.
