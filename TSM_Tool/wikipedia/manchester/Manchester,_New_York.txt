Manchester was an important division point and car classification yard for the Lehigh Valley Railroad and was, at one time, the largest such facility in the world.
As a division point, crews and locomotives were exchanged.
Freight cars were switched from track to track, organizing them for delivery to their destinations.
Support services included the 30-stall roundhouse, the coaling tower, facilities for ash removal, track maintenance, car repair, a control tower, the yard office, an ice house, and the bunkhouse-restaurant.
With the failure of the Pennsylvania Railroad (which had taken over operations of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1962) in the mid-60s, the division yard's purpose was largely unneeded.
By the next decade, all that remained in use at the yard was the mainline travelling through the town.
Today only a few crumbling structures, some old track, and a couple of rusted boxcars remain.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 37.8 square miles (97.9 km²), of which, 37.8 square miles (97.8 km²) is land and 0.0 square mile (0.1 km²) (0.08%) is water.
