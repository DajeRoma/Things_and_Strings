Manchester-by-the-Sea (or simply Manchester) is a town on Cape Ann, in Essex County, Massachusetts, in the United States.
The town is known for scenic beaches and vista points.
At the 2010 census, the town population was 5,136.
Manchester was first settled by Europeans in 1629 and was officially incorporated in 1645.
It was formed out of territory taken from Salem (that portion since given to Beverly) and Gloucester.
The community thrived primarily as a fishing community for over 200 years.
Its economy shifted to that of a Boston area summer colony starting in 1845, when Richard Dana, a Boston-based poet, built a house in the town.
Over the next fifty years, development of summer houses along the coastline established the community as Boston society's community of choice for summer residency.
The trend continued with designs by other notable architects, such as "Sunny Waters", designed by John Hubbard Sturgis for his older brother, Russell, in 1862.
The most famous of these "summer cottages" was Kragsyde, built on Smith's Point in 1883 and demolished in 1929.
Commissioned by George Nixon Black, the Peabody and Stearns-designed residence has been hailed as the zenith of the Shingle style substyle of the Queen Anne style of architecture.
Name
To prevent confusion with the nearby and much larger city of Manchester, New Hampshire, the name of the town was officially changed in 1989 following a close town meeting vote that year and an act of the state legislature passed on September 25, 1989.
The name change was driven by Edward Corley, a longtime resident of Manchester.
All town documents, and the town seal, now use the name "Manchester-by-the-Sea", and as a result o some minor resident activism, so do the majority of public and private lists of Massachusetts cities and towns, including that of the state government.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 18.3 square miles (47.3 km2), of which 9.2 square miles (23.9 km2) is land and 9.0 square miles (23.4 km2), or 49.47%, is water.
The town lies along the North Shore of Massachusetts Bay, which in turn leads to the Atlantic Ocean.
There are seven beaches lining the coast, and several small islands dot the coast, the largest being Kettle Island and House Island.
Several small coves line the coast, the largest being Manchester Harbor, which is fed by Sawmill Brook and other small brooks.
There are several protected areas within town, including Cedar Swamp Conservation Area, Cheever Commons Conservation Area, Coolidge Reservation, Dexter Pond, Owl's Nest Nature Preservation Land, Powder House Hill Reservation, and Wyman Hill Conservation Area.

Route 127 also passes from west to east through town, traveling through the center of town.
There is no bus service directly into town, with service passing east via the Cape Ann Transportation Authority in Gloucester and MBTA Bus, which provides service to Beverly.
The town is served by a stop along the Newburyport/Rockport Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail, providing service from Rockport along the North Shore to Boston's North Station.

Singing Beach
One mile from the town center is Singing Beach, so named because the sand comprising the beach squeaks when walked upon (see Singing sand).
This beach is quite popular during summer months in particular because it is easily accessible from Boston by a half-mile walk from the MBTA train station.
Also located on this historic beach is the famous tourist attraction "Eaglehead", a rock composite that is the focal point of rock climbing and other recreation activities.
