The people of Oxford and the Oxford Historical Society were honored for their work in preserving the Homestead, and designated with a Connecticut Trust Preservation Award.
The award was presented in Hartford at the State Capitol on April 4, 2012.
The following is from the Connecticut Trust website: "Built in 1755, this house has a long connection with prominent local families and is listed on the State Register of Historic Places.
When development threatened the house, the developer was convinced to donate it to the Town.
Moved to a new, town-owned site, the house received a new foundation and chimney base, and was restored by the Oxford Historical Society.
A multitude of workers donated their labor to the project, including members of building trades, Boy and Girl Scouts, area foundations, and many local volunteers.
The people of Oxford succeeded where many towns and small nonprofits fail by involving a wide range of people throughout the community.
The task of managing so many different groups and individuals alone is a remarkable achievement. "
