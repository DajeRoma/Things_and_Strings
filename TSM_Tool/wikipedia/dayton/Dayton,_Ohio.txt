Dayton (/ˈdeɪtən/; local pronunciation: /ˈdeɪʔn/) is the sixth-largest city in the U.S. state of Ohio and is the county seat of Montgomery County.
A small portion of the city extends into Greene County.
In the 2010 census, the population was 141,527, and the Dayton metropolitan area had 799,232 residents, making it Ohio's fourth-largest metropolitan area, after Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus and the 63rd-largest in the United States.
The Dayton-Springfield-Greenville Combined Statistical Area had a population of 1,080,044 in 2010, making it the 43rd-largest in the United States.
Dayton is within Ohio's Miami Valley region, just north of the Cincinnati–Northern Kentucky metropolitan area.
Ohio's borders are within 500 miles (800 km) of roughly 60 percent of the country's population and manufacturing infrastructure, making the Dayton area a logistical centroid for manufacturers, suppliers, and shippers.
Dayton also hosts significant research and development in fields like industrial, aeronautical, and astronautical engineering that have led to many technological innovations.
Much of this innovation is due in part to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and its place within the community.
With the decline of heavy manufacturing, Dayton's businesses have diversified into a service economy that includes insurance and legal sectors as well as healthcare and government sectors.
Other than defense and aerospace, healthcare accounts for much of the Dayton area's economy.
Hospitals in the Greater Dayton area have an estimated combined employment of nearly 32,000 and a yearly economic impact of $6.8 billion.
It is estimated that Premier Health Partners, a hospital network, contributes more than $2 billion a year to the region through operating, employment, and capital expenditures.
In 2011, Dayton was rated the No.
3 city in the nation out of the top 50 cities in the United States by HealthGrades for excellence in health care.
Many hospitals in the Dayton area are consistently ranked by Forbes, U.S. News & World Report, and HealthGrades for clinical excellence.
Dayton is also noted for its association with aviation; the city is home to the National Museum of the United States Air Force and is the birthplace of Orville Wright.
Other well-known individuals born in the city include poet Paul Laurence Dunbar and entrepreneur John H. Patterson.
Dayton is also known for its many patents, inventions, and inventors that have come from the area, most notably the Wright brothers' invention of powered flight.
In 2008, 2009, and 2010, Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the No.
1 mid-sized metropolitan area in the nation for economic development.
Also in 2010, Dayton was named one of the best places in the United States for college graduates to find a job.
Dayton was founded on April 1, 1796, by 12 settlers known as "The Thompson Party."
They traveled in March from Cincinnati up the Great Miami River by pirogue and landed at what is now St. Clair Street, where they found two small camps of Native Americans.
Among them was Benjamin Van Cleve, whose memoirs provide insights into the Ohio Valley's history.
Two other groups traveling overland arrived several days later.
In 1797, Daniel C. Cooper laid out Mad River Road, the first overland connection between Cincinnati and Dayton, opening the "Mad River Country" to settlement.
Ohio was admitted into the Union in 1803, and the city of Dayton was incorporated in 1805.
The city was named after Jonathan Dayton, a captain in the American Revolutionary War who signed the U.S. Constitution and owned a significant amount of land in the area.
In 1827, construction on the Dayton-Cincinnati canal began, which would provide a better way to transport goods from Dayton to Cincinnati and contribute significantly to Dayton's economic growth during the 1800s.
Historically, Dayton has been the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s.
According to the National Park Service, citing information from the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870.
The Wright brothers, inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton.
The city was also home to James Ritty's "Incorruptible Cashier", the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E. Morgan's "hydraulic jump", a flood prevention mechanism that helped pioneer modern-day hydraulic engineering.
Paul Laurence Dunbar – a famous African-American poet and novelist – penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became an integral part of the city's history.
Innovation led to business growth in the region.
In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his cash register patents and formed the National Cash Register Company (NCR).
The company manufactured the first mechanical cash registers and played a crucial role in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s.
In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, helped develop the first electric cash register, which propelled NCR into the national spotlight.
NCR also helped develop the US Navy bombe, a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II.
A catastrophic flood in March 1913, known as the Great Dayton Flood, led to the creation of the Miami Conservancy District, a series of dams and hydraulic jumps installed around Dayton, in 1914.
Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II.
Several locations around the city hosted the Dayton Project, a branch of the larger Manhattan Project, to develop polonium triggers used in early atomic bombs.
The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high demand for housing and other services.
At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.
Between the 1940s and the 1970s, the city saw significant growth in suburban areas from population migration.
Veterans were returning from military service in large numbers seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, a part of the local industry that was expanding rapidly.
Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom.
New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area.
More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County alone during the 1950s.
Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's population has declined, mainly due to the loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national housing crisis that began in 2008.
While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most.
Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind only Cleveland and Youngstown.
Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.
Downtown expansion that began in the 2000s has helped revitalize the city and encourage growth.
Fifth Third Field, home of the Dayton Dragons, was built in 2000.
The highly successful minor league baseball team has been an integral part of Dayton's culture.
In 2001, the city's public park system, Five Rivers MetroParks, built an outdoor entertainment venue known as RiverScape MetroPark that attracts more than 400,000 visitors each year.
A new performance arts theater, the Schuster Center, opened in 2003.
A large health network in the region, Premier Health Partners, expanded its Miami Valley Hospital with a 12-story tower addition.
In 2010, the Downtown Dayton Partnership, in cooperation with the City of Dayton and community leaders, introduced the Greater Downtown Dayton Plan.
It focuses on job creation and retention, infrastructure improvements, housing, recreation, and collaboration.
The plan is to be implemented through the year 2020.
Peace accords
In 1995, the Dayton Agreement, a peace accord between the parties to the hostilities of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia, was negotiated at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Fairborn, Ohio, from November 1 – 21.
Richard Holbrooke wrote about this event in his memoirs:
There was also a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as the birthplace of the Wright brothers.Its citizens energized us from the outset.
Unlike the population of, say, New York City, Geneva or Washington, which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history.
Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the "temporary center of international peace".
The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings.
When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us.
Warren Christopher was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant.
Families on the air base placed "candles of peace" in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base.
One day they formed a "peace chain", although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base.
Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.
Nickname
Dayton is known as the "Gem City."
The nickname's origin is uncertain, but several theories exist.
In the early 19th century, a well-known racehorse named "Gem" hailed from Dayton.
In 1845, an article published in the Cincinnati Daily Chronicle by an author known as "T" stated:
In a small bend of the Great Miami River, with canals on the east and south, it can be fairly said, without infringing on the rights of others, that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns.
It possesses wealth, refinement, enterprise, and a beautiful country, beautifully developed.
In the late 1840s, Major William D. Bickham of the Dayton Journal began a campaign to nickname Dayton as the "Gem City".
The name was adopted by the city's Board of Trade several years later.
Paul Laurence Dunbar referred to the nickname in his poem, "Toast to Dayton", as noted in the following excerpt:
Dayton also plays a role in a nickname given to the state of Ohio: "Birthplace of Aviation".
Dayton is the hometown of the Wright brothers, aviation pioneers who are credited with inventing and building the world's first successful airplane.
After their first manned flights in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, which they had chosen due to its ideal weather and climate conditions, the Wrights returned to Dayton and continued testing at nearby Huffman Prairie.
Additionally, Dayton is colloquially referred to as "Little Detroit".
This nickname comes from Dayton's prominence as a Midwestern manufacturing center.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 56.50 square miles (146.33 km2), of which 55.65 square miles (144.13 km2) is land and 0.85 square miles (2.20 km2) is water.
Climate
Dayton's climate features hot, muggy summers and cold, dry winters, and is either classified as a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), using the −3 °C (26.6 °F) isotherm of the original Köppen scheme, or a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), using the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm preferred by some climatologists.
Unless otherwise noted, all normal figures quoted within the text below are from the official climatology station, Dayton International Airport, which, at an elevation of 1,000 ft (304.8 m) about 10 mi (16 km) to the north of downtown Dayton, which lies within the valley of the Miami River, and thus temperatures there are typically cooler than in downtown.
At the airport, monthly mean temperatures range from 27.5 °F (−2.5 °C) in January to 74.1 °F (23.4 °C) in July.
The highest temperature ever recorded in Dayton was 108 °F (42 °C) on July 22, 1901, and the coldest was −28 °F (−33 °C) on February 13, 1899.
On average, there are 14 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs and 4.5 nights of sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows annually.

For other Dayton-area communities, see their respective articles.
Dayton's population declined significantly from a peak of 262,332 residents in 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010.

Architecture
Unlike many Midwestern cities its age, Dayton has very broad and straight downtown streets (generally two or three full lanes in each direction) that improved access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular.
The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and shipping center from its beginning: streets were broad to enable wagons drawn by teams of three to four pairs of oxen to turn around.
In addition, some of today's streets were once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.
A courthouse building was built in downtown Dayton in 1888 to supplement Dayton's original Neoclassical courthouse, which still stands.
