Arlington is a town in Bennington County, Vermont, United States.
The population was 2,317 at the 2010 census.
The town of Arlington was chartered July 28, 1761, by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth, as part of the New Hampshire Grants.
In 1777, Arlington became the first capital of the Vermont Republic.
Among the first settlers in Arlington were Captain Jehiel Hawley and his family, who had settled there by 1764.
They were Anglicans and had fled Roxbury, Connecticut, because of the oppressive requirements of the established Congregational church.
At a Proprietor's meeting in 1764, the town voted to give 50 acres (20 hectares) of land to any man who would set up a gristmill in what is now East Arlington.
This offer was accepted by Remember Baker (first cousin of Ethan Allen), who built a grist and sawmill.
In the years leading up to the American Revolution, both New York and New Hampshire laid claim to lands comprising current-day Vermont.
The Province of New York began to grant land in 1765, lagging New Hampshire by four years.
Arlington was, for the most part, settled by Anglicans from Roxbury, Newtown, and Milford, Connecticut, with ownership rights derived from the New Hampshire Grants.
When settlers with New York grants arrived, conflicts ensued.
Among other things, the residents of Arlington relied on the militancy of Ethan Allen to discourage those touting New York grants.
Ethan Allen and his group were known by their friends as the Green Mountain Boys.
They were relatively effective in promoting the cause of New Hampshire grantees, although legal ownership was not settled monetarily for many years.
Several members of the Green Mountain Boys lived, in Arlington, before the American Revolution, including Thomas Chittenden, Seth Warner and Remember Baker, who was the first town clerk.
Gideon Hard, a congressman, from New York, was born in Arlington.
During the American Revolutionary War, the Patriot soldiers, of the Green Mountain Boys, rallied, against Loyalist opposition, in the town.
British Loyalist citizens, in Arlington, united under the leadership of Dr. Samuel Adams, organized an independent, military unit, Adams' Rangers, to support the British war effort, in the region.
In 1777, Adams' men saw action, fighting for British General John Burgoyne, at the Battle of Saratoga, in the Province of New York and were soundly defeated.
Arlington lies in the Valley of Vermont between the Taconic Range to the west and the Green Mountains to the east, with most of Arlington's land mass lying in the Taconic Range.
Five prominent peaks are located within the town: Grass Mountain, Spruce Peak, The Ball (also locally referred to as West Mountain), Red Mountain, and Big Spruce Mountain.
