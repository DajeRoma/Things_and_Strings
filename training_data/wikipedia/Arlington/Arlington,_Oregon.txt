Arlington is a city in Gilliam County, Oregon, United States.
The account of how the city received its name varies; one tradition claims it was named after the lawyer Nathan Arlington Cornish, while another tradition claims that the Southern inhabitants of the city had enough clout to rename the city after Arlington, Virginia, home of general Robert E. Lee.
The city's population was 586 at the 2010 census.
Originally named Alkali, Arlington came into existence as a place for shipping cattle down the Columbia River.
It was incorporated as Arlington by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on November 20, 1885.
Following the completion of the John Day Dam, the original location of Arlington was moved to higher ground in 1963 to avoid the resulting inundation.
Arlington was the birthplace of musician Doc Severinsen, best known as the musical director for the American television program The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1967–1992).
In 2008, it was discovered that Mayor Carmen Kontur-Gronquist had posted photos of herself in lingerie online, which, along with several other issues, led to her recall from office.

Arlington is home to a sizable Waste Management landfill, notably receiving all of Seattle, Washington's trash and some from Portland, Oregon.
In March 2010, Waste Management announced their plans to build a waste gasification plant next to their landfill that uses a plasma gasification technology that at the time was considered experimental.
The plasma gasification plant was built in conjunction with the company, InEnTec, whose efforts to build such plants in California and elsewhere have met fierce protest.
The plant went into pilot operation in November 2011.
The Shepherds Flat Wind Farm and controversies about it emerged in 2009 and 2010, with completion originally scheduled for 2012.
