Ashland is a city in Ashland and Bayfield counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin.
The city is a port on Lake Superior, near the head of Chequamegon Bay.
The population was 8,216 at the 2010 census, all of which resided in the Ashland County portion of the city.
The tiny unpopulated Bayfield County portion is located in the city's southwest, bordered by the easternmost part of the Town of Eileen.
The city is situated at the junction of U.S. Route 2 and Wisconsin Highway 13.
It is the home of Northland College, Wisconsin Indianhead Technical College, and the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute.
Pre-settlement
Four flags have flown over the area around Ashland: Spanish, French, English and American.
Eight Indian nations have lived on Chequamegon Bay.
Later settlers included European explorers, missionaries and fur traders, and more recently, Yankees who platted and developed the lands, railroaders, shippers, loggers, entrepreneurs, and other settlers.
The area was part of the Northwest Territory and was subsequently part of four successive territories before becoming part of the state of Wisconsin: Indiana Territory, Michigan Territory, Illinois Territory, and Wisconsin Territory.
About the time Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World, the Ojibwe people came to the land they called Sha-ga-waun-il-ong.
This term has been translated numerous ways: "lowlands", the "needle", "the region of shallow water", and where "there are large extended breakers".
Each is descriptive and suitably accurate.
The Ojibwe stayed on Chequamegon Point for about a century before leaving, first to settle on Madeline Island and then to move to the Sault region.
French fur traders Pierre d'Esprit, le Sieur Radisson and Medard Chouart, le Sieur des Groseillers were the first Europeans of record to visit Chequamegon Bay.
They arrived in 1659 and built what has been called the first European dwelling place in Wisconsin.
A historical marker is located at Maslowski Beach on U.S. Route 2 on the west end of Ashland.
The monument was erected in 1929 by the Old Settlers Club.
The Ojibwe heartily welcomed the Frenchmen.
Five years later, Father Claude-Jean Allouez arrived.
A Jesuit missionary, he brought the first word of Christianity to Wisconsin's shores.
Allouez built a chapel not far from Radisson's and Groseillier's stockade and remained at the Bay until 1669.
Settlement
In 1854, Ohioans Asaph Whittlesey and George Kilborn set out from La Pointe to explore the head of Chequamegon Bay.
Whittlesey built a 10 ft (3.0 m) × 14 ft (4.3 m) cabin in Ashland.
His wife, Lucy, and daughter, Eugenia, joined him in August and prepared to winter in their new home.
Signs of civilization quickly followed.
The first community dance was held at their house.
The Reverend L.H.
Wheeler preached the first sermon on the first Independence Day that was observed there.
It was the location of the first post office and polling place for county offices.
Sunday school was also conducted on the premises.

Three deaths were reported.
Ore dock
The harbor of Ashland was dominated by the massive Wisconsin Central Railway (later Soo Line) ore dock, built in 1916 to load iron ore mined in the area into freighters bound for ports in the Rust Belt.
The last of what were once many such docks, the concrete structure is 80 feet (24 m) high and 75 feet (23 m) wide and in 1925 the dock was extended to 1,800 feet (550 m); it was last used to ship ore in 1965.
In 2007 the Wisconsin Trust for Historic Preservation named it one of the "10 most endangered historic buildings in Wisconsin", a list intended to stir preservation efforts.
The main concrete structure and trestle slowly deteriorated since the early 1970s because of lack of maintenance and the effects of the environment.
A structural inspection completed in 2006 and 2007 concluded that the ore dock had become structurally unsafe and was an imminent safety hazard.
On May 14, 2009, the Ashland Planning Commission granted Canadian National Railway approval for the demolition.
All material on the ore dock was removed down to the concrete base.
This was completed in 2013.
The base of the ore dock remains.
The city took ownership of it from Canadian National Railway in May, 2014.
It is working with a consultant group to design a redevelopment plan for the base of the dock.
Ashland is located along the south shore of Chequamegon Bay.
