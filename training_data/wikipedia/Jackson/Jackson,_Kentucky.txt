Jackson is a home rule-class city in Breathitt County, Kentucky, in the United States.
It is the seat of its county.
The population was 2,231 according to the 2010 U.S. census.
It was the home of the Jackson Academy, which became Lees College.
Upon the creation of Breathitt County in 1839, local landowner Simon Cockrell Sr. donated 10 acres (4.0 ha) to serve as its seat of government.
The community was originally known as Breathitt, Breathitt Town, or Breathitt Court House after the county, but upon its incorporation as a city by the state legislature in 1843, it was renamed Jackson to honor the recently deceased former president Andrew Jackson.
Local feuds led the national press to publish stories about Jackson and "Bloody Breathitt": state troops were dispatched twice in the 1870s and again in 1903 – after the assassination of U.S. Commissioner James B. Marcum on the courthouse steps – to restore order.
The Kentucky Union Railroad reached the city in 1891, and Jackson boomed until the L&N continued the line on to Hazard in 1912.
A fire on Halloween, 1913, burned down much of the town.
Jackson is located at 37°33′11″N 83°23′18″W (37.553012, -83.388249).
The city is nestled in the heart of the Cumberland Plateau of the Appalachian Mountains, with the downtown located on the north bank of the North Fork of the Kentucky River.
To limit flooding, the Kentucky River was redirected in 1963 by way of a small cut-through through the mountain, and its former channel, a river meander, was left behind as Panbowl Lake, now a prime attraction for fishermen.
According to the United States Census Bureau, Jackson has a total area of 2.7 square miles (6.9 km2), of which 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2) is land and 0.15 square miles (0.4 km2), or 6.11%, is water.

Kentucky Routes within the city
KY 15 The highway goes north to Campton and the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway and south to Hazard and the Hal Rogers Parkway.
It is the main artery into the city and, currently, it is being relocated and changed to four lanes around and inside the city.
It has been locally named (within the county) as the Breathitt County Veterans Highway.
KY 30 The highway goes east to Salyersville and west to Booneville.
It merges with KY 15 (at the present time) throughout most of the city.
The west end is known, locally, as Booneville Road.
KY 52 The highway's eastern terminus starts in the city of Jackson at the intersection with KY 30 and heads west towards Beattyville.
It is locally known as Beattyville Road.

The highway's southern terminus starts at the intersection of KY 15.
Recently, an old section of KY 15 was annexed to the highway, and it is possible, once more of the re-routed KY 15 is finished, that it could annex more of the old KY 15 sections.
KY 1812 -Not a Primary State Highway - The highway goes north to Campton and south to intersect and end near the KY 15 and KY 30 junction in Jackson.
In the north, it connects with KY 205 and follows it until it intersects with the new section of KY 15; it follows KY 15 for a mile and then splits only to intersects KY 15 in Jackson once more; it then breaks away only to connect (partially) with Main Street and then heads south.
It is part of what was once the original KY 15 when it was built in 1925.
It can be a winding and curvy road in many places with a few hairpin turns as well.
It is known locally by different names depending on which road it intersects or what section.
i.e.
Old Quicksand Rd., Broadway, College Ave, Brown St., Main Street, Washington Ave., Panbowl Rd., and so on.
