Mount Vernon was the birthplace of Cooper Industries.
There is a large industrial complex in the western part of the city that manufactures and repairs products for the gas and oil power generation industries.
It was acquired by Rolls-Royce North America, and in 2014 Siemens bought the Mount Vernon plant.
Face a declining market, the company has announced major reductions in employment.
Ariel Corporation, a major manufacturer of reciprocating natural gas (and other gasses) compressors, is also located in Mount Vernon.
Its history is tied to that of Cooper Industries in that Jim Buchwald, one of the founders of Ariel, was a former engineer for Cooper Industries Mount Vernon.
