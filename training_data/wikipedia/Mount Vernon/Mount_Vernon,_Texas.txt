Mount Vernon is a town in Franklin County, Texas, United States.
It is the Franklin County seat, and the population was 2,662 at the 2010 census, up from 2,286 at the 2000 census.
Mount Vernon started as a settlement near the Fanning Springs (on Holbrook Street south of the present town square).
Affidavits filed to establish land titles soon after the Texas Revolution document the settlement by squatters in Spanish Texas commencing in 1818.
By 1848 the United States government established a post office, and in 1849 a formal town site was laid out on land donated by Stephen and Rebecca Keith for the town of Mount Vernon.
Since there were two other Mount Vernons in Texas, the post office was called "Keith" and then "Lone Star" before the name "Mount Vernon" became available in 1875.
Franklin County was carved out of Titus County in 1875, and Mount Vernon was elected county seat in competition with other communities.
The county's economy was based in agriculture with corn and cotton, followed by over 500,000 peach trees in production in the 1920s, watermelons in the 1930s, and the state's top record production of cane syrup in the 1940s.
The 1936 discovery of oil on C.G.
Hughes' land in the north part of the county led to a more diversified economy, with oil production continuing today combined with light industry, manufacturing, and diverse agricultural endeavors.
Mount Vernon, as county seat, was assured a continuing vital existence as the economic center for the county.
The town boasted churches, doctors, lawyers, and many varied stores in a time before people had the ability to travel far.
The town voted to incorporate in 1910 under a mayor/council form of government.
In 1911 a bond issue was passed to create a public waterworks.
Electric and gas utility service followed.

In March, community volunteers manned an office space provided by First National Bank (now serving as office for the Franklin County Chamber of Commerce), and opened the library for donations including books, furniture, and cash.
An initial $5,192 was raised to establish the library as a member of the Northeast Texas Library System.
Also needed was 3,500 books (donated or purchased) within a three-year period.
By the close of 1977 the Key Club reported the library had received cash donations of $25,000 and had exceeded the three-year goal for accumulation of books.
The library opened to check out books and serve the public with a full-time librarian on April 1, 1977.
In December 1977, the First National Bank deeded the historic 1912 bank building to the county for use as the library.
In January 1979 the library opened the downstairs of its current location and in 1980 the library expanded to the second floor.
There have been several renovations made throughout the years, the latest in 1997.
