Milford is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States.
It is located across the Penobscot River from the city of Old Town.
The population of Milford was 3,070 at the 2010 census.
The town's slogan is the "Best little town by a dam site," referring to the Milford Dam abutting Milford on the Penobscot River, south of the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation.
Milford was the site of a major 19th century water powered sawmill on the Penobscot River.
Most of its lumber was shipped from nearby Bangor.

It was designed by Wallace C. Johnson, a civil engineer who also worked on hydro-power projects at Niagara Falls.
