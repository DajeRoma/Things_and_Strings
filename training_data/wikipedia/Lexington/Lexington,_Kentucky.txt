Lexington, consolidated with Fayette County, is the second-largest city in Kentucky and the 61st largest in the United States.
Known as the "Horse Capital of the World", it is the heart of the state's Bluegrass region.
With a mayor-alderman form of government, it is one of two cities in Kentucky designated by the state as first-class; the other is the state's largest city of Louisville.
In the 2015 U.S. Census Estimate, the city's population was 314,488, anchoring a metropolitan area of 500,535 people and a combined statistical area of 723,849 people.
Lexington ranks tenth among US cities in college education rate, with 39.5% of residents having at least a bachelor's degree.
It is the location of the Kentucky Horse Park, The Red Mile and Keeneland race courses, Rupp Arena, the world's largest basketball-specific arena, Transylvania University, the University of Kentucky, and Bluegrass Community & Technical College.
This area of fertile soil and abundant wildlife was long occupied by varying tribes of Native Americans.
European explorers began to trade with them but settlers did not come in force until the late 18th century.
Lexington was founded by European Americans in June 1775, in what was then considered Fincastle County, Virginia, 17 years before Kentucky became a state.
A party of frontiersmen, led by William McConnell, camped on the Middle Fork of Elkhorn Creek (now known as Town Branch and rerouted under Vine Street) at the site of the present-day McConnell Springs.
Upon hearing of the colonists' victory in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, they named their campsite Lexington.
It was the first of what would be many American places to be named after the Massachusetts town.
The risk of Indian attacks delayed permanent settlement for four years.
In 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, Col. Robert Patterson and 25 companions came from Fort Harrod and erected a blockhouse.
They built cabins and a stockade, establishing a settlement known as Bryan Station.
In 1780, Lexington was made the seat of Virginia's newly organized Fayette County.
Colonists defended it against a British and allied Shawnee attack in 1782, during the last part of the American Revolutionary War.
The town was chartered on May 6, 1782, by an act of the Virginia General Assembly.
The First African Baptist Church was founded c. 1790 by Peter Durrett, a Baptist preacher and slave held by Joseph Craig.
Durrett helped guide "The Travelling Church", a group migration of several hundred pioneers led by the preacher Lewis Craig and Captain William Ellis from Orange County, Virginia to Kentucky in 1781.
It is the oldest black Baptist congregation in Kentucky and the third oldest in the United States.
In 1806, Lexington was a rising city of the vast territory to the west of the Appalachian Mountains; poet Josiah Espy described it in the following letter:
Lexington is the largest and most wealthy town in Kentucky, or indeed west of the Allegheny Mountains; the main street of Lexington has all the appearance of Market Street in Philadelphia on a busy day ...
I would suppose it contains about five hundred dwelling houses [it was closer to three hundred], many of them elegant and three stories high.
About thirty brick buildings were then raising, and I have little doubt but that in a few years it will rival, not only in wealth, but in population, the most populous inland town of the United States ...
The country around Lexington for many miles in every direction, is equal in beauty and fertility to anything the imagination can paint and is already in a high state of cultivation.
Residents have fondly continued to refer to Lexington as "The Athens of the West" since Espy's poem dedicated to the city.
In the early 19th century, planter John Wesley Hunt became the first millionaire west of the Alleghenies.
The growing town was devastated by a cholera epidemic in 1833, which had spread throughout the waterways of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys: 500 of 7,000 Lexington residents died within two months, including nearly one-third of the congregation of Christ Church Episcopal.
London Ferrill, second preacher of First African Baptist, was one of three clergy who stayed in the city to serve the suffering victims.
Additional cholera outbreaks occurred in 1848–49 and the early 1850s.
Cholera was spread by people using contaminated water supplies, but its transmission was not understood in those years.
Often the wealthier people would flee town for outlying areas to try to avoid the spread of disease.
Planters held slaves for use as field hands, laborers, artisans, and domestic servants.
In the city, slaves worked primarily as domestic servants and artisans, although they also worked with merchants, shippers, and in a wide variety of trades.
Plantations raised commodity crops of tobacco and hemp, and thoroughbred horse breeding and racing became established in this part of the state.
In 1850, one-fifth of the state's population were slaves, and Lexington had the highest concentration of slaves in the entire state.
It also had a significant population of free blacks, who were usually of mixed race.
By 1850, First African Baptist Church, led by London Ferrill, a free black from Virginia, had a congregation of 1,820 persons, the largest of any, black or white, in the entire state.
Many of 19th-century America's leading political and military figures spent part of their lives in the city, including U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and Confederate President Jefferson Davis (who attended Transylvania University in 1823 and 1824); Confederate general John Hunt Morgan; U.S.
Senator and Vice President John C. Breckinridge; and Speaker of the House, U.S.
Senator, and Secretary of State Henry Clay, who had a plantation nearby.
Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln was born and raised in Lexington, and the couple visited the city several times after their marriage in 1842.
During the 19th century, migrants moved from central Kentucky to Tennessee and Missouri.
They established their traditional crops and livestock in Middle Tennessee and an area of Missouri along the Missouri River.
While Kentucky stayed in the Union during the American Civil War, the residents of different regions of the state had divided loyalties.
20th century to present
In 1935 during the Great Depression, the Addiction Research Center (ARC) was created as a small research unit at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington.
Founded as one of the first drug rehabilitation clinics in the nation, the ARC was affiliated with a Federal prison.
Expanded as the first alcohol and drug rehabilitation hospital in the United States, it was known as "Narco" of Lexington.
The hospital was later converted to operate as part of the federal prison system; it is known as the Federal Medical Center, Lexington and serves a variety of health needs for prisoners.
Lexington has continued as the center of thoroughbred horse breeding and racing in Kentucky, with major racing and sales facilities, as well as a museum of horses and the sport.
Lexington, which includes all Fayette County, consists of 285.5 square miles (739.4 km2), mostly gently rolling plateau, in the center of the inner Bluegrass Region.
The area is noted for its fertile soil, excellent pastureland, and horse and stock farms.
Poa pratensis (bluegrass) thrives on the limestone beneath the soil's surface, playing a major role in the development of champion horses; it is associated with the area's beauty of landscape.
Numerous small creeks rise and flow into the Kentucky River.
The Lexington-Fayette Metro area includes five counties: Clark, Jessamine, Bourbon, Woodford, and Scott.
This is the second-largest metro area in Kentucky after that of Louisville.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 285.5 square miles (739 km2).
284.5 square miles (737 km2) of it is land and 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2) of it (0.35%) is water.
Cityscape
Lexington features a diverse cityscape.
Forbes has ranked Lexington as one of the world's seventeen cleanest cities.
Planning
Lexington must manage a rapidly growing population while working to maintain the character of the surrounding horse farms that give the region its identity.
In 1958 Lexington enacted the nation's first Urban Growth Boundary, restricting new development to an Urban Service Area.
It set a strict minimum area requirement, currently 40 acres (160,000 m2), to maintain open space for landholdings in the Rural Service Area.
In 1967, the Urban Service Area was decreased in area; various zoning regulations were also amended from the original 1958 issue.
Several years later, in 1973, the first Lexington Comprehensive Plan was completed.
In 1980, the Comprehensive Plan was updated: the Urban Service Area was modified to include Urban Activity Centers and Rural Activity Centers.
The Urban Activity Centers were commercial and light-industrial districts in urbanized areas, while Rural Activity Centers were retail trade and light-industrial centers clustered around the Interstate 64/Interstate 75 interchanges.
In 1996, the Urban Service Area was expanded when 5,300 acres (21 km2) of the Rural Service Area was acquired through the Expansion Area Master Plan.
This was controversial: this first major update to the Comprehensive Plan in over a decade was accompanied by arguments among residents about the future of Lexington and the thoroughbred farms.
The Expansion Area Master Plan included new concepts of impact fees, assessment districts, neighborhood design concepts, design overlays, mandatory greenways, major roadway improvements, stormwater management, and open space mitigation for the first time.
It also included a draft of the Rural Land Management Plan, which included large-lot zoning and traffic impact controls.
A pre-zoning of the entire expansion area was refuted in the Plan.
A 50-acre (200,000 m2) minimum proposal was defeated.
Discussion of this proposal appeared to stimulate the development of numerous 10-acre (40,000 m2) subdivisions in the Rural Service Areas.
Three years after the expansion was initiated, the Rural Service Area Land Management Plan was adopted, which increased the minimum lot size in the agricultural rural zones to 40-acre (160,000 m2) minimums.
In 2000, a Purchase of Development Rights plan was adopted, granting the city the power to purchase the development rights of existing farms; in 2001, $40 million was allocated to the plan from a $25 million local, $15 million state grant.
An Infill and Redevelopment study was also initiated during that time, along with design guidelines for the areas surrounding the new Fayette County courthouses.

According to the United States Census, of Lexington's population over the age of twenty-five, 22.4% hold a bachelor's degree, 11.4% hold a master's degree, and 3.1% hold a professional degree.
Just 2.6% hold a doctorate degree.
Lexington was ranked 10th in a list of America's most educated cities with a population of more than 250,000, ranked by percentage of bachelor's degrees among residents 25 and older, according to the United States Census Bureau.
In a report released by Jack Miller, president of Central Connecticut State University, Lexington ranks 13th in the United States in terms of literacy rate.
The index was compiled through six indicators of literacy, including Internet sources, newspaper circulation, the number of bookstores, library resources, education and periodical resources.
The city is served by the Fayette County Public Schools (FCPS).
The system currently consists of five district high schools, along with multiple smaller multi-district high schools, 12 middle schools, one combined middle/high school, and 37 elementary schools, and is supplemented with many private schools.
FCPS opened two new elementary schools in August 2016, and is nearing completion of a sixth high school that is scheduled to open in August 2017.
There are also two traditional colleges: the University of Kentucky, which is the state's flagship public university, and Transylvania University, which is the state's oldest four-year university and the first university west of the Alleghenies.
Other institutions of higher learning include Bluegrass Community and Technical College, Sullivan University, Spencerian College, Medtech College, Strayer University, Commonwealth Baptist College, and a distance-learning extension of Indiana Wesleyan University.
Seven other postsecondary institutions are within the Lexington Combined Statistical Area: Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary, separate though related institutions in Wilmore; Georgetown College in Georgetown; Midway University, with its main campus in Midway and an extension campus in Lexington; Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond; Berea College in Berea, and Kentucky State University in Frankfort.

The state's public television network, Kentucky Educational Television (KET), is headquartered in Lexington and is one of the nation's largest public networks.
Highways
The northeast border of Lexington has direct access to Interstate 64 and Interstate 75, but freeways do not run through downtown or other sections of the city.
Instead, Lexington has two beltways: inner New Circle Road (KY 4) and outer Man o' War Boulevard (southern semi-circle), then numerous arterial highways/U.S.
routes radiate from downtown to the surrounding suburbs and small towns.
Lexington suffers considerable traffic congestion for a city of its size due to the lack of freeways, the proximity of the University of Kentucky to downtown, and the substantial number of commuters from outlying towns.
For traffic relief on northern New Circle Road, Citation Boulevard is planned to connect Leestown Road and Russell Cave Road.
Other proposed projects include widening/closing certain roads and changing directions from one-way to two-way.
Air
Blue Grass Airport is Lexington's primary commercial airport.
It provides approximately 13 nonstop flights and a total of 86 flights daily from its two runways.
Five major airlines operate connection service at Blue Grass, including Allegiant Air, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, United Express, and US Airways Express.
On August 27, 2006, Comair Flight 5191 took off from the wrong runway, and crashed in a nearby field, killing 49 of the 50 passengers, leaving the first officer alive but badly burned.
The aircraft involved was a 50-seat Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-100ER, serial number 7472.
On August 27, 2011, a memorial sculpture depicting 47 steel birds flying was unveiled and dedicated to the victims.
The airport is located four miles (six km) west of the city center, at the intersection of US 60 (Versailles Road) and Man o' War Boulevard.
In addition to commercial airline service, the airport is also home to several private (general aviation) operators including TACAir, which serves as the airport's FBO (Fixed-Base Operator).
Flight training and aircraft maintenance services are also offered.
A brand new general aviation runway was dedicated August 4, 2010.
Public transportation
Lexington is served by Lextran, a public transit bus agency operated by LFUCG and has been in existence since 1972.
Lextran (officially the Transit Authority of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government) is a public transportation bus system serving Lexington, Kentucky.
It runs bus routes throughout the city which mostly all converge in downtown at the Lexington Transit Center located at 220 East Vine.
It provides public transportation in the form of buses and lift vans.
It operates seven days a week on a total of 24 bus routes from 5:00 a.m. until 12:30 a.m.
In addition to mainline and paratransit, Lextran contracts with the University of Kentucky and operates two routes around the campus.
It also runs two routes to the Bluegrass Community and Technical College campuses.
Even though Lexington and Fayette County are a consolidated government, Lextran does not provide service outside the Lexington city proper due to limited funding sources.
Transportation planning
The Lexington Area Metropolitan Planning Organization is responsible for transportation planning for Fayette and Jessamine Counties.
This includes activities such as carpool matching, administering a commuter vanpool program, air quality forecasting, bicycle and pedestrian planning, congestion management, and developing transportation plans and documents.
Sister cities
Lexington has four sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:
Deauville, Calvados, Normandy, France since 1957
County Kildare, Leinster, Ireland since 1984
Newmarket, Suffolk, England, United Kingdom since 2003
Shinhidaka, Japan since 2006
Shinhidaka was formed by a 2006 local government merger.
One of the entities involved in the merger was Shizunai, which established a sister city relationship with Lexington in 1988.
All four are, like Lexington, major centers of the Thoroughbred breeding industry in their respective countries.
