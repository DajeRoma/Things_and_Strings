Lexington Harbor was constructed and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as authorized by the River and Harbor Act of 1965.
The harbor serves mainly recreational boating activities and contains launch/retrieval ramps, fueling facilities, and 190 berthing slips which are operated by both public and private agencies.
Due to infiltration of sediment through and along the peripheral breakwalls, the harbor requires regular dredging to maintain navigable channels.
The dredging occurs approximately every 3 to 5 years, with excavated sediment deposited onto the beaches surrounding the breakwalls.
