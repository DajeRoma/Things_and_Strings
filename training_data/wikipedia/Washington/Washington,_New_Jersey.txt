Washington is a borough in Warren County, New Jersey, United States.
As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 6,461, reflecting a decline of 251 (-3.7%) from the 6,712 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 238 (+3.7%) from the 6,474 counted in the 1990 Census.
The borough is located in the eastern most region of the Lehigh Valley.
Washington was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 20, 1868, from portions of Washington Township.
The borough was named for George Washington, one of more than ten communities statewide named for the first president.
The Borough of Washington is surrounded by Washington Township, which is one of five municipalities in the state of New Jersey with the name "Washington Township".
Washington Borough separated from Washington Township as of February 20, 1868.
The community grew during the 19th century as a result of the transportation routes that ran through or near the borough.
The Morris Canal ran along the north end of town and two rail lines of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad crossed within the borough.
Intersecting in the center of the borough are two major roadways, which today are Route 31 and Route 57.
The borough was ultimately named for the "Washington House", a tavern built by Revolutionary War Col. William McCullough in 1811 that was later destroyed by fire in 1869.
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the borough became a mecca of musical instruments manufacturers, the manufacture of organs in particular.
A bustling downtown developed around these businesses.
Many of the Victorian style houses in the borough, as well as Taylor Street School and Warren Hills Middle School (formerly Washington High School) were built during this period.
The advent of the automobile brought Washington closer to both the Lehigh Valley and New York City.
In the years following World War II, the population increased, and there were many new houses and apartment complexes built.
A portion of the Downtown area was devastated by a major fire in 1962.
Education at the Middle and High School level was regionalized in 1968, and a new elementary school was also built (Memorial School).
The 1990s saw a population boom in Warren County, which continues today, as high real estate prices and property taxes in New Jersey's northeastern counties push buyers to look further west.
Although the borough itself does not have much room to grow, it has benefited from the growth of the nearby townships.
Efforts are underway to revitalize the downtown with new residential and retail properties.
According to the United States Census Bureau, Washington borough had a total area of 1.945 square miles (5.039 km2),including 1.942 square miles (5.030 km2) of land and 0.003 square miles (0.009 km2) of water (0.18%).
The borough of Washington is completely surrounded by Washington Township, making it part of 21 pairs of "doughnut towns" in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.
Pohatcong Mountain is a ridge, approximately 6 mi (9.7 km) long, in the Appalachian Mountains that extends from west Phillipsburg northeast approximately to Washington.
Upper Pohatcong Mountain extends northeast of Washington approximately 6 mi (9.7 km) to the vicinity of Hackettstown.
The two ridges are sometimes called "Pohatcong Mountain" collectively.
