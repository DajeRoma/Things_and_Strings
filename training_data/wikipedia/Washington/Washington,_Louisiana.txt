During the American Civil War, the Thirteenth Connecticut, part of Union General Nathaniel P. Banks' forces, occupied Washington, then larger than the parish seat of Opelousas.
Washington was, according to the historian John D. Winters in The Civil War in Louisiana "squalid and dirty .
.
.
[with] filth, ugly buildings, and its large number of black inhabitants."
Winters reports that Banks' men operated from Washington, Opelousas, New Iberia, and Alexandria in "gathering cotton, vegetables, molasses, rum, sugar, saddles, bridles, horses, mules, cattle, corn, and sweet potatoes.
Negroes were mounted and assisted in driving in the cattle and horses found hidden in the woods and swamps.
Between eight and ten thousand bales of cotton were collected.
It was estimated that the .
.
.
region was stripped of legitimate forage valued at more than ten million dollars.

Washington was the birthplace of Louisiana Governor Oramel H. Simpson, who served from 1926 until his defeat by the legendary Huey Pierce Long, Jr. in the 1928 Democratic gubernatorial primary.
John Travis Nixon, newspaper publisher in Monroe and Crowley, formerly resided in Washington; his wife, Leona White Nixon, a prominent educator was a native of St. Landry Parish.
Arthur T. Prescott, the founding president of Louisiana Tech University and a long-time administrator at Louisiana State University, was reared on a sugar plantation near Washington.
Washington holds the annual Festival du Courtableau, now renamed the Washington Catfish Festival.
According to a 2007 report, Washington was named among the ten worst speed traps in the state of Louisiana.
Washington made 50.84 percent of its revenue, an average of roughly $370 per capita population, from fines and forfeitures in the 2005 fiscal year.
A motorist passing through for the Catfish Festival could be ticketed for going two miles over the speed limit.
In 2014, State Representative Alan Seabaugh targeted Washington as the most "notorious" speed trap in the state.
He obtained approval of the House Transportation Committee to allow enforcement of traffic laws only if a community had incorporated at least one-half mile of land that extends to each side of an interstate highway, excluding overpasses and ramps.
Seabaugh said that he receives many complaints from his constituents in Shreveport and even out-of-state residents who have been ticketed for speeding when exceeding the 75 m.p.h.
limit only by a mile or two.
