Franklin is a town in Macon County, Alabama, United States.
The 2010 census placed the population at 149, unchanged from 2000.
Franklin School was in operation as early as the 1890s teaching grades 1–11.
By the mid-1930s it was downsized to grades 1-6.
There were northern and southern classrooms adjoined by a common auditorium.
The school's original water source was a spring near the buildings.
A well was later dug in the front yard of the school, with a hand pump that provided the water.
Heat was provided by a wood-burning potbelly stove.
Each student brought a stick of wood every morning for use in the stove.
The school closed in 1942, and its 75–80 students transferred to Tuskegee schools.
After the close of the school the northern classroom was moved to its current location, converted to a community center.
The rest of the school was torn down.
During its use as a community center, Hank Williams Sr. often performed for dances.
Upon Franklin's 1977 incorporation, the town began using the building as the town hall.
A mile north of Town Hall lay the remnants of what is rumored to be the first school in Macon County.
Located at the corner of Co. Rd.
27 and 36 and restored as a historic museum, Harris Barrett School was built in 1903 with handmade bricks made by Tuskegee Normal School (now Tuskegee University) students under the direction of Booker T. Washington.
