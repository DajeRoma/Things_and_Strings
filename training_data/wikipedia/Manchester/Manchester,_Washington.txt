Manchester is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kitsap County, Washington, United States.
The population was 4,958 at the 2000 census.
Manchester was established in the 1860s and was originally known as Brooklyn, after the borough in New York City.
The name was changed to Manchester in 1892 in honor of the city of Manchester, England.
Manchester was accessible by land via Shelton/Allyn/Belfair, however, the main population center, Seattle, had only boat access.
After a permanent dock was built in 1908, regular steamboat service connected Manchester to nearby communities like Colby, Southworth, and Harper, and to Seattle across the water.
From 1925 to 1936, a ferry route across Puget Sound connected Manchester with Alki Point in West Seattle.
When the Alki Point dock washed away in 1936, the Seattle terminus was shifted to Colman Dock on the Seattle central waterfront.
Ferry service was discontinued in 1949 and has never resumed.
In 1940, the US Navy built a pier nearby for refueling ships.
The fuel pier saw heavy use during World War II, and still operates today.
In 1953, the library in Manchester was slated for destruction.
The town pulled together and a new library was constructed in 1954.
Today, Manchester has excellent views of Seattle, Mt.
Rainier, and Puget Sound, has a public boat launch, a boat parade on the opening day of boating season, and salmon sponsors bakes at the Manchester library.
