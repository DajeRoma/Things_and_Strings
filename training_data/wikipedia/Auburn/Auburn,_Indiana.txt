Auburn's site on Cedar Creek was chosen by Wesley Park and John Badlam Howe at the intersection of two major trails, Goshen-Defiance Road and Coldwater Road, and next to the land of John Houlton.
The name for the community likely came from "The Deserted Village" by Oliver Goldsmith, that begins "Sweet Auburn!
Loveliest village of the plain."
The plat of the Village of Auburn is dated April 21, 1836, but it was held by Howe and not recorded until March 12, 1879.
John Drury purchased the first lot (Lot 73) for $25.00 on September 5, 1837.
The first store was built at Park's corners by Thomas Freeman, applying for a license on March 5, 1838, and bringing supplies by horseback from Fort Wayne.
