Hudson is a city in Summit County, Ohio, United States.
The population was 22,262 at the 2010 census.
It is a suburban community in the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area, the 15th largest Combined Statistical Area in the United States.
The city is named after its founder, David Hudson, who settled there from Goshen, Connecticut in 1799, when it was part of the Connecticut Western Reserve.
Hudson was a stop on the Underground Railroad.
The Hudson-born Pennsylvania coal mine owner James Ellsworth assisted in the rebuilding of Main Street with a new clock tower after the street had been destroyed by fire in 1903.
Ellsworth also refinanced the bankrupt Western Reserve Academy which had been closed from 1903 until 1916.
On November 28, 1973, a large area of the village, "roughly bounded by College, Streetsboro, S. Main, and Baldwin" streets, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Hudson Historic District.
The historic district was expanded on October 10, 1989, to also include the area "roughly bounded by Hudson St., Old Orchard Dr., Aurora St., Oviatt St., Streetsboro St., and College St. to Aurora (street)".
In addition to the Hudson Historic District, there are several additional properties in Hudson listed on the Register.
From 1837 to 1994, the Village of Hudson and Hudson Township were two separate governing entities.
In 1994, voters approved a merger uniting the two to create the City of Hudson.
The brick Clock tower near the center of Hudson is a very familiar and also very tall historic place in Hudson.
