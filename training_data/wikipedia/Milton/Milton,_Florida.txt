The settlement was originally known as "Scratch Ankle", because of the briars and bramble that grew in the area.

Other names were "Lumberton", "Black Water" and "Hard Scrabble", but by 1839, it was being referred to as "Milltown".
Milton was incorporated as a city in 1844, one year before the Territory of Florida joined the United States as the 27th state.
