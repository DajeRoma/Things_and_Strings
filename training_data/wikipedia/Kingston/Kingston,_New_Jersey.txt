Not to be confused with Barclay-Kingston, New Jersey or Kingston Estates, New Jersey.
Kingston is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) along the border of South Brunswick Township in Middlesex County and Franklin Township in Somerset County, in New Jersey, United States.
At the 2010 United States Census, the CDP's population was 1,493, of which 1,222 were in South Brunswick Township and 271 in Franklin Township.
The New Jersey State Planning Commission created the Kingston Village Advisory Committee to address issues related to this distinct area.
Both South Brunswick and Franklin appoint members to the committee, which holds an annual meeting to discuss issues pertinent to the Kingston area.
Kingston is located in five historic districts and is part of the Millstone River Valley Scenic Byway.
The Delaware and Raritan Canal and Rockingham State Historic Site are a short distance away.
Jediah Higgins purchased 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) from the Native Americans in the early 18th century and the town of Kingston was established.
Kingston's location on the Lenape Assunpink Trail where it crossed the Millstone River and later becoming part of the King's Highway was the prime factor in its early prominence.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of 2.326 square miles (6.025 km2), of which, 2.238 square miles (5.796 km2) of it was land and 0.088 square miles (0.229 km2) of it (3.80%) was water.

Kingston Presbyterian Church
The Kingston Presbyterian Church was organized in 1723 and was initially located in a log building adjacent to the Millstone River.
The old tombstones surround the site where the church once stood in the Kingston Cemetery.
The Reverend Eleazer Wales was the first recorded minister of the church.
The original church building in the cemetery burned down in 1791, and new building was erected in 1792 on the original foundation.
The congregation used this building until 1852, when the larger building on Main Street in Kingston was constructed on land purchased from Elijah Stout.
In 1853, the church building in the cemetery was sold and was later dismantled.
Two additions were constructed on the 1852 site.
Sunday school rooms were added to the back of the structure in the late 1940s.
In the late 1980s another addition was added which added a new kitchen facility, additional space in the assembly room, pastors study and office.
The church suffered through some difficult times during the remainder of the 1700s.
During this period, Princeton University was built and the village of Princeton expanded, while the population of Kingston declined.
(At that time, Kingston extended as far as Snowden Lane.)
Consequently, the church lost many members to the "new" Presbyterian Church down the road in Princeton.
It was also during this time that the Revolutionary War was fought in the area, and British officers were quartered in local homes.
Gen. Washington became a recognizable figure in the Kingston area at the time.
Not only did he led his troops past the church to escape Cornwallis, but he also had his headquarters hardly a mile from the church while the Continental Congress sat in Nassau Hall.
In 1800, the Kingston Presbyterian Church began a period of prosperity and growth, which continues to this day.
The church sent its first foreign missionaries to China in the early 1800s.
Kingston United Methodist Church
During the month of February 1878, the people of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Rocky Hill brought an evangelist, Miss Lizzie Sharp, to conduct revival meetings in their church.
There were some twenty or more of Kingston people who attended these meetings, and who decided to form a Methodist church in Kingston.
A site was purchased for $250 on what is now Church Street, across from the Kingston Cemetery.
Building began September 20, 1878, and was completed and dedicated on January 30, 1879.
A nursery was later added.
