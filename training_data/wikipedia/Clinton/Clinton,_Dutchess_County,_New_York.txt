Clinton is a municipal subdivision of Dutchess County, New York, United States.
The population was 4,312 at the 2010 census.
The town as a governmental subdivision is standard in New York and New England and analogous to townships in other regions.
The current boundaries of the town of Clinton were set in 1821.
The general area was part of a British land grant in 1697 known as the Great Nine Partners Patent.
In 1734 a soil survey was done in the Great Nine Partners patent running in 1 1/2 mile wide strips from the Hudson river east through the patent.
The particular strip running at the bottom of the patent including the future hamlet of Clinton Corners was classified as good land.
In 1737 the patents were reorganized into precincts, with the current town of Clinton being part of the Charlotte precinct from 1762 until 1788.
In 1788 the Dutchess County Legislature reorganized the precincts into towns with Clinton formed from parts of Charlotte and Rhinebeck precincts and named in commemoration of the service of Governor George Clinton.
In 1821 the current boundaries were set when the towns of Pleasant Valley and Hyde Park were created out of the larger Clinton township.
The early European settlers in Clinton filtered in from two main directions.
In the early 1700s, Rhinebeck was the largest settlement in Dutchess County taking advantage of the Hudson River for transportation of people and produce.
Across Dutchess county to the east the settlements of Amenia and Wassaic in the Harlem river valley were also attracting European settlers.
In 1718 a road was established branching off from the central Wassaic-Poughkeepsie road to connect to the northern Amenia-Rhinbeck road at the Crum Elbow creek crossing.
In 1748 the road commissioners from Rhinebeck and Crum Elbow precincts met at the bridge over Crum Elbow Creek to discuss the "old wissasiek road" (pg.15) which had been in existence for 30 years.
One of those commissioners was Mordecai Lester.
His home and his son's home were mentioned in the commission's report as landmarks along the road north and south of the hamlet of Clinton Corners.
In addition to the early Dutch and English settlers, by the mid 1700s German Palatines were moving into the western regions of Clinton.
By the 1770s Quakers were moving up into Clinton from the southeast.
Clinton participated in the Civil War with men enlisting in the 128th and 150th regiments.
After the war ended, dairy farmers brought their milk by wagon to the creamery in the hamlet of Clinton Corners by the tracks of the Poughkeepsie and Eastern Railway.
This rail line continued to the Grove Amusement Park at the southeast end of Upton Lake and the ice house at the northeast end of the lake.
After the Poughkeepsie and Eastern declined with the advent of the automobile, the park closed.
During the last half of the 20th century, the town of Clinton has transformed from an agricultural to a residential center.
