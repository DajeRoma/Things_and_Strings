Clinton is a city in Clinton Township, Vermillion County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.
The population was 4,893 at the 2010 census.
The city was established in 1829 and is named after DeWitt Clinton, who served as governor of New York from 1817 to 1823.
Many of Clinton's original settlers were immigrants working in coal mines.
Most of the immigrants were Italians trying to earn a living coal mining.
According to Vermillion County naturalization records, "...from 1856 to 1952... Vermillion County received almost 3,550 new citizens of foreign birth, the largest number coming during the first twelve years of [the 20th] century.
Italians accounted for one-third, or 1,178, of the total number who filed Declarations, with Austrians the next largest group (675) and then Scots.
At least 77 percent of the Italians were from the northern regions of Italy."
This was in contrast to the majority of Italian immigrants to America during this same time period that hailed from southern Italy.
Over time, the coal mining industry in Clinton died down but many of the Italian settlers stayed at Clinton.
The Clinton post office has been in operation since 1823.
In 2016, a satirical news website posted a fake news story about the town, claiming that the mayor was changing the town's name to avoid referencing Bill and Hillary Clinton.
The Clinton Paving and Building Brick Company was established in 1893, at which time it was producing 40,000 bricks per day.
The Clinton Downtown Historic District and Hill Crest Community Center are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Clinton, Indiana has three primary elementary schools, one middle school and one high school.
The three elementary schools are Central Elementary School, Van Duyn Elementary School and Ernie Pyle Elementary School.
Glendale Elementary and Matthew's South Elementary schools, which were both located in Clinton City limits, consolidated with Central Elementary in the mid 1980s.
Clinton's residents could fit into one main elementary school, but because of all the rural area around Clinton it makes more sense to group all the students into three smaller schools.
The middle school and high school are neighboring each other.
The middle being South Vermillion Middle School, and the high being South Vermilion.
The high school was formerly known as Clinton High School before the current school was constructed in 1977.
