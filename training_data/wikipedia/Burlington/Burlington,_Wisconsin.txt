Burlington is a city in Racine and Walworth counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin, with the majority of the city located in Racine County.
The population of the portion of the city inside Racine County was 10,464 as of the 2010 census.
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the area, Native American mounds were constructed near the present location of Burlington.
For example, around 1830, a small Potawatomi village stood in what is now the Town of Burlington, though it wasn't larger than the present-day city.
The earliest certain European presence in what is now Burlington was in the fall of 1799, when a group of French explorers and missionaries led by Francis Morgan de Vereceones made a portage from the Root River to the Fox River, reaching the Fox at approximately Burlington's present location.
The first European settlers in Burlington were Moses Smith (the son of a Revolutionary War veteran) and William Whiting.
Smith and Whiting had been in the area previously, making a so-called "jackknife claim" to the land (carving their names and the date on trees in the vicinity) on December 15, 1835.
The men then left the encampment and returned with Lemuel Smith (Moses' brother) as well as Benjamin Perce, another member of the group.
The four men searched for arable land and built a cabin on the east side of the Fox River (on what is now Wehmhoff-Jucker Park.)
Other settlers arrived in the spring and summer of 1836, mostly from New England; they named their settlement Foxville.
That year, the residents of Foxville unanimously decided to change their settlement's name to "Burlington" after the city Burlington, Vermont; the Foxville name continued to be used, however, until that name was officially changed on July 15, 1839.
Since its establishment, Foxville had been in Michigan Territory.
On July 3, 1836, however, an act of Congress organizing the Wisconsin Territory went into effect, and Foxville fell within the borders of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin Territory, which at that time included the present-day county of Racine.
The two counties separated on December 7, 1836, and Foxville ended up in Racine County.
The first post office in Foxville was created on March 21, 1837, with Moses Smith, one of the four founders of the city, as the first postmaster.
In May 1837, a sawmill (the first frame building in the settlement) and a dam on the Fox River were completed.
On January 2, 1838, Rochester township, which included Foxville as well as all of Racine County west of Mount Pleasant, was established.
On March 9, 1839, Burlington township (including at the time what is now the Town of Dover) and much of Brighton were separated from Rochester.
Burlington was a major New England settlement.
The original founders of Burlington consisted entirely of settlers from New England, and inherited "Yankee" culture, that is, they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s.
They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s.
Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal.
When they originally arrived in the area, there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie.
The settlers laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.
They brought with them many of their "Yankee" New England values, such as staunch support for abolitionism as well as a passion for education and the subsequent construction of many schools.
They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church, though some were Episcopalian.
Due to the second Great Awakening some of them had converted to Methodism before moving to what is now Burlington.
Burlington, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally similar to early New England for most of its early history.
From 1844 to 1850, the town of Voree, just to the west of Burlington, was the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), one of many sects founded during the LDS succession crisis following the death of Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith.
Although James Strang's group relocated to Beaver Island, Michigan in 1850, his parents remained in Voree.
After Strang was shot by two disgruntled members in 1856, he was taken to Voree where he died.
He is buried in a cemetery in Burlington.
Strang's church still maintains a congregation in Voree to this day, and the local historical society has erected a monument to the Mormon settlement there.
Burlington was incorporated as a village in 1886; in 1900 it became a city.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.73 square miles (20.02 km2), of which, 7.50 square miles (19.42 km2) is land and 0.23 square miles (0.60 km2) is water.

The settlement's first schoolhouse was built in 1839, and classes were taught there irregularly for the next 15 years.
An act of the Wisconsin Legislature in 1857 incorporated the Burlington Union School District of Racine County.
In 1858 and 1859, a schoolhouse was built for the district's use.
Now called Lincoln School (Burlington, Wisconsin), the building is now used as the headquarters for the Burlington Area School District.
Early quarrels about the management and costs of the school led to the creation of two rival school boards, each claiming to be legal; a new board gained control in 1861, and lasting stability came to the system in 1872.
Burlington is now served by the Burlington Area School District.
The district has eight schools, six in Burlington.
A campus of the Gateway Technical College is also in Burlington.
Private and parochial schools

The first newspaper in the Burlington area was the Voree Herald, published in Voree in January 1846 by James Strang, the leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite).
Its primary purpose was to inform his congregation about events in the wider Latter Day Saint movement.
The paper was renamed the Gospel Herald in September 1847, and continued to be published until 1850, when most of the church relocated to Beaver Island in Lake Michigan.
The first newspaper published in Burlington intended for a general audience was the Weekly Burlington Gazette, first published on April 8, 1858.
The newspaper was strongly Republican and continued until December 11, 1860, when its owner moved to Houston, Texas.
From 1860 until 1863, no newspaper was published in Burlington.
On October 14, 1863, the Burlington Standard, another Republican newspaper, was founded.
In 1881, the paper became largely nonpartisan, but in April 1886, with a new owner, the paper was renamed the Standard Democrat and became strongly pro-Democrat.
From 1896 to 1911, the Standard Democrat was also published in German under the name Der Standard Demokrat.
The Burlington Democrat, a newspaper with Democratic leanings, was first published in 1880 as a counter to the Republican Burlington Standard.
Its name was soon changed to the Burlington Free Press, and its leanings changed to Republican at about the same time the Standard became the Standard Democrat.
The weekly Burlington Standard Press is currently published in Burlington; the daily Racine Journal-Times, Kenosha News, and Milwaukee Journal Sentinel are also available in the area.

Railroads
The first railroad to pass through Burlington was built in 1855 by the Racine, Janesville and Mississippi Railroad Company.
Its construction nearly bankrupted Racine.
The line was later reorganized as the Western Union Railroad and eventually incorporated into the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company, .
(better known as the Milwaukee Road) On the Milwaukee Road, this line was referred to as the "Racine & Southwestern" Division and is often referred to as the "Southwestern" Line.
In 1856, Burlington invested in the Fox River Valley Railroad of Wisconsin, a planned railroad that would have started in Milwaukee, connected to the railroad already in Burlington, and continued on to the Fox River Valley Railroad of Illinois.
The roadbed was built, but because of the failure of the company, rails were never laid.
The railroad currently operating through Burlington was constructed in 1885-1886 by the Wisconsin Central Railroad.
The Wisconsin Central was acquired by the Minneapolis St. Paul & Sault Ste.
Marie Railway in 1908, and later merged with the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway in 1961 to create the Soo Line Railroad.
The Milwaukee Road operated its last train west of Burlington in 1982.
In 1985 the Soo Line purchased what remained of the Milwaukee Road, and reorganized their existing line through Burlington as a part of a new subsidiary known as Lakes States Transportation Division in 1986.
Lakes States did not achieve the cost savings that the Soo Line had envisioned and was sold to the new Wisconsin Central Transportation, which commenced operations on October 11, 1987.
The Wisconsin Central Limited was acquired by the Canadian National Railway in 2001.
The Canadian National Railway remains the operator of the rail line through Burlington.
