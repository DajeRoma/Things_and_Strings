Burlington is an agricultural center and town in northwestern Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, United States.
The population was 152 at the 2010 census.
Originally the town of Burlington was named "Drumm", for prominent cattle rancher Major Andrew Drumm.
Major Drumm had operated the 150,000 acre U Ranch in the area from 1874 until 1888 on land leased from the Cherokees and was a founder of the Cherokee Strip Live Stock Association.
Drumm was also the founder of the Andrew Drumm Institute in Independence Missouri.
Its post office was established under the name Drumm on June 6, 1906.
But when the initial plans in July 1907 to rename the town "Wheaton" fell through, the town's name was officially changed to Burlington on August 21 of that year, which it remains to this day.
A member-owned agricultural cooperative called Burlington Grain Company was formed in 1916.
It currently operates as Burlington Cooperative Association.
