Salem is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States.
The population was 28,776 at the 2010 census.
Salem is a marketing and distributing center north of Boston, with a major amusement attraction, Canobie Lake Park, and a large shopping mall, the Mall at Rockingham Park.
The area was first settled in 1652.
As early as 1736, Salem was the "North Parish" of Methuen, Massachusetts, or "Methuen District."
In 1741, when the boundary line between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was fixed, the "North Parish" became part of New Hampshire, and was given the name "Salem," taken from nearby Salem, Massachusetts.
It was incorporated in 1750 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth.
In 1902, Canobie Lake Park was established in Salem by the Massachusetts Northeast Street Railway Company, to encourage leisure excursions on its trolleys.
The plan was successful, and the enterprise quickly became one of the leading resorts of its type in New England.
Crowds arrived from all over, including the nearby mill towns of Haverhill, Lawrence, Lowell and Methuen in Massachusetts, and Manchester and Nashua in New Hampshire.
Factory workers and others found respite strolling along tree-lined promenades, between flower-beds or beside the lake.
Rides, arcades and a dance hall provided lively entertainments.
The rise of the automobile, however, brought the decline of the trolley.
But Canobie Lake Park, one of the few former street railway amusement resorts still in existence, continues to be popular.
Other features of Salem's tourism history include Rockingham Park Race Track, the first horse race track in New England, and "America's Stonehenge", a curiosity (formerly "Mystery Hill").
A recent attraction in town is the Icenter, a skating arena.
Starting in the 1950s, Salem developed rapidly as part of Greater Boston, with suburban-style residential neighborhoods and a long strip of commercial development along NH Route 28.
Recent (c. 2006) commercial construction has continued to focus on Route 28, as well as on the commercial zone off Exit 2 on Interstate 93.
The Manchester and Lawrence branch of the B&M railroad ran through Salem until 2001.
In 2009, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation commissioned a study exploring reactivation of the branch and instituting commuter rail service connecting to the MBTA Haverhill Line and onward to Boston.
The study's cost/benefit analysis recommended taking no action to reactivate beyond preserving the option for consideration at a future time.
Salem's town government consists of a board of selectmen and a town manager.
Salem is a part of New Hampshire Senate District 22 and has nine representatives to the New Hampshire House.
The state senator for Salem is Senate President Chuck Morse.
The state representatives of Salem are Ronald Belanger, John Sytek, Joe Sweeney, Arthur E. Barnes III, Robert Elliot, Gary Azarian, Fred Doucette, Anne Priestly and John J. Manning Jr.
