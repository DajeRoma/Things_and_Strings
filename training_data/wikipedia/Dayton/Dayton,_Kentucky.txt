Dayton is a home rule-class city along a bend of the Ohio River in Campbell County, Kentucky, in the United States.
The population was 5,338 at the 2010 census.

To the north, across the Ohio River, is Cincinnati in Hamilton County, Ohio.
The closest bridge across the Ohio is the Daniel Carter Beard Bridge on Interstate 471, connecting Newport with Cincinnati.
According to the United States Census Bureau, Dayton has a total area of 1.9 square miles (5.0 km2), of which 1.3 square miles (3.3 km2) is land and 0.66 square miles (1.7 km2), or 33.61%, is water.
Dayton is located within Kentucky's Outer Bluegrass region in the Upper South.
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Dayton has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.
Dayton had a ferry crossing, established in this area by the early 19th century, at the foot of what is now Dayton Street.
Two separate cities, Jamestown and Brooklyn, separately incorporated in 1848 and 1849 respectively, were merged and reïncorporated in 1867 under the name Dayton in honor of the Ohio town.
Jamestown was incorporated March 1, 1848.
According to the state charter, the founding fathers were James Berry, James McArthur and Henry Walker.
Berry was a nephew of James Taylor, Jr., founder of Newport, Kentucky.
Dayton has a large sandbar just offshore.
It had a popular beach for many years known as the "Manhattan Bathing Beach", until the US Army Corps of Engineers raised the level of the Ohio River.
Laws were passed prohibiting nude swimming in the Ohio River during daylight hours and prohibiting dogs from running loose.
Violators of the nude swimming law faced a penalty of $1 for the first offense and as much as $5 for subsequent offenses.
People also had the right to shoot dogs that were running loose in the city, and bill the owners for carcass removal.
Floods in 1884, 1913, and 1937 – the latter affecting 80 percent of the city and prompting residents to take shelter in the garages of the former Wadsworth Watch Case Co. – caused many of the companies in the once-booming town to move elsewhere.
By the 1950s, many residents, weary of constant flooding, moved out of the town as well.
A floodwall was finally completed in late 1981.
Today, Dayton is working on downtown revitalization and a historical survey of the city; it is the first step toward creating a historic district in the city.
