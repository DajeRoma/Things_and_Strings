Centerville is a city in Houston County, Georgia, United States.
The city is a part of the larger Macon-Warner Robins Combined Statistical Area.
It was incorporated March 25, 1958.
As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 7,148.
The town along with many suburban areas in the United States is seeing unprecedented growth in population that has slowed in recent years.
It used to be a bedroom community for the nearby growing city of Warner Robins.
The town has been working to develop a type of downtown area in recent years though this has stalled somewhat since Councilman Jon Nichols who was spearheading the push was not re-elected in the city's most recent election in 2015.
Contrary to popular belief, Centerville owes its name not to its geographical position within the state of Georgia, but its position between Byron and Wellston (now Warner Robins).
It is also midway between Perry and Macon, Georgia.
The city is home to the Galleria Mall, the largest mall in the Warner Robins area and the second largest in the Macon metropolitan area—smaller than Macon Mall.
There are over 50 stores located within and its anchor stores include Sears, JCPenny, and Belk.
Other major retailers in the mall include American Eagle, GameStop, GNC, Cricket Wireless, Victoria's Secret, Chick-fil-A, FYE, Hibbett Sports, as well as various smaller brand stores and eateries.
The mall is connected to the Galleria Mall Stadium Cinemas which, after an addition of new screens, is the primary movie theater in the area that shows new and current releases.

The Centerville city limit abuts those of Warner Robins'; although originally, they were separated by unincorporated land.
As Warner Robins grew, it annexed land westward, eventually becoming contiguous with the city limits of Centerville.
Centerville, along with Warner Robins, continues to annex land and expand west towards I-75, geographically around the Georgia State Route 247 Connector, also known as Watson Boulevard.
