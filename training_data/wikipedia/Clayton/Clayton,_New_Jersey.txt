Local government
Clayton is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government.
The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election.
A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office.
The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.
The Borough form of government used by Clayton, the most common system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie.
The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council.
The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
As of 2016, the Mayor of the Borough of Clayton is Democrat Thomas Bianco, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2019.
Members of the Borough Council are Council President Tony Saban (D, 2016), Frank Brown Jr. (D, 2018; appointed to serve an unexpired term), Sandra "Sandi" Kraus (D, 2016), Chris Rogers (D, 2018), Charles Simon (D, 2017) and Darlene Vondran (D, 2017).
In 2016, Franklin Brown was appointed to replace Brian Bicking, serving a term of office expiring in December 2016.
Clayton describes itself in its motto as "a great place to live and play, work and pray."
The seal, which has been used since the late 1960s, features an image of a factory, a house and a figure fishing off a boat, along with a church with a cross, which has been challenged by the Freedom From Religion Foundation in March 2016 as "unmistakably religious" and unconstitutional.
