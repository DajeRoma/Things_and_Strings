Winchester is a city in Lewis County, Idaho, United States, located on the Camas Prairie in the north central part of the state.
The population was 340 at the 2010 census, up from 308 in 2000.
Winchester is within the Nez Perce Indian Reservation, and similar to the opening of lands in Oklahoma, the U.S. government opened the reservation for white settlement in November 1895.
The proclamation had been signed less than two weeks earlier by President Cleveland.
The city was named in 1900 during a meeting to establish a school district.
While considering the possibilities, an individual looked at the stack of Winchester rifles at the door and suggested the name, which was approved.
The sawmill closed in May 1965 after the mature timber in the area had been cut.
The mill was operated by Boise Cascade for its final five years; its closure followed a fire which destroyed much of downtown Winchester in November 1964.
A half mile (1 km) outside of town is Winchester Lake State Park, planned in 1966 and established in 1969.
Originally it was a mill pond, created in 1910 by damming Lapwai Creek.
Water quality issues at the lake were addressed with the installation of aeration units in 2002.
Winchester is located at 46°14′27″N 116°37′24″W , at an elevation of 3,980 feet (1,210 m) above sea level.

Highway
- US 95 - to Lewiston (north) and Grangeville (south)
The city is two miles (3 km) west of U.S. Route 95, which connects it to Craigmont to the east and Lewiston to the northwest, via the Lapwai Canyon.
Until 1960, US 95 was routed through Winchester on this spur and descended Culdesac Hill (46.332°N 116.633°W﻿ / 46.332; -116.633), considered the worst of the three major grades (White Bird, Lewiston), all of which were extremely twisty.
The new route through Lapwai Canyon was built in three years and reduced the distance by over four miles (6 km) and saved 25 minutes of driving time.
The earlier road was completed in 1923.
The first organized road race on the old road took place in 1964; among the participants in the hill climb was Bob Knievel of Butte, Montana, later known as Evel Knievel.
The timber trestles of the former Camas Prairie Railroad are visible throughout the area.
The public schools are in Craigmont, operated by the Highland Joint School District #305, led by Highland High School.
The consolidated district was formed in 1962; prior to that Winchester had its own schools and the high school's mascot was a logger.
